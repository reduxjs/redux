# The Redux Logo

This is the only official Redux logo.  
Don't use any other logos to represent Redux.  

It comes in several flavors.

## Modifications

Whenever possible, we ask you to use the originals provided on this page.

If for some reason you must change how the title is rendered and can't use the prerendered version we provide, we ask that you use the free [Lato Black](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) font and ensure there is enough space between the logo and the title.

When in doubt, use the original logos.
