/**
 * A *reducer* (also called a *reducing function*) is a function that accepts
 * an accumulation and a value and returns a new accumulation. They are used
 * to reduce a collection of values down to a single value
 *
 * Reducers are not unique to Redux—they are a fundamental concept in
 * functional programming.  Even most non-functional languages, like
 * JavaScript, have a built-in API for reducing. In JavaScript, it's
 * `Array.prototype.reduce()`.
 *
 * In Redux, the accumulated value is the state object, and the values being
 * accumulated are actions. Reducers calculate a new state given the previous
 * state and an action. They must be *pure functions*—functions that return
 * the exact same output for given inputs. They should also be free of
 * side-effects. This is what enables exciting features like hot reloading and
 * time travel.
 *
 * Reducers are the most important concept in Redux.
 *
 * *Do not put API calls into reducers.*
 *
 * @template S The type of state consumed and produced by this reducer.
 * @template A The type of actions the reducer can potentially respond to.
