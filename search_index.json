consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.\nYou can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn Redux from its creator:Part 1: Getting Started with Redux (30 free videos)\nPart 2: Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux (27 free videos)\n\nTestimonials\n\n“Love what you're doing with Redux”Jing Chen, creator of Flux\n“I asked for comments on Redux in FB's internal JS discussion group, and it was universally praised. Really awesome work.”Bill Fisher, author of Flux documentation\n“It's cool that you are inventing a better Flux by not doing Flux at all.”André Staltz, creator of Cycle\n\nBefore Proceeding Further\n\nAlso read:You Might Not Need Redux\n\nDeveloper Experience\nI wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called “Hot Reloading with Time Travel”. My goal was to create a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\nInfluences\nRedux evolves the ideas of Flux, but avoids its complexity by taking cues from Elm.Whether you have used them or not, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\nInstallation\nTo install the stable version:\nnpm install --save redux\nThis assumes you are using npm as your package manager.  \nIf you're not, you can access these files on unpkg, download them, or point your package manager to them.\nMost commonly people consume Redux as a collection of CommonJS modules. These modules are what you get when you import redux in a Webpack, Browserify, or a Node environment. If you like to live on the edge and use Rollup, we support that as well.\nIf you don't use a module bundler, it's also fine. The redux npm package includes precompiled production and development UMD builds in the dist folder. They can be used directly without a bundler and are thus compatible with many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. For example, you can drop a UMD build as a  tag on the page, or tell Bower to install it. The UMD builds make Redux available as a window.Redux global variable.\nThe Redux source code is written in ES2015 but we precompile both CommonJS and UMD builds to ES5 so they work in any modern browser. You don't need to use Babel or a module bundler to get started with Redux.\nComplementary Packages\nMost likely, you'll also need the React bindings and the developer tools.\nnpm install --save react-redux\nnpm install --save-dev redux-devtools\nNote that unlike Redux itself, many packages in the Redux ecosystem don't provide UMD builds, so we recommend using CommonJS module bundlers like Webpack and Browserify for the most comfortable development experience.\nThe Gist\nThe whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers.\nThat's it!\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer, a pure function with (state, action) => state signature.\n * It describes how an action transforms the state into the next state.\n *\n * The shape of the state is up to you: it can be a primitive, an array, an object,\n * or even an Immutable.js data structure. The only important part is that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * In this example, we use a `switch` statement and strings, but you can use a helper that\n * follows a different convention (such as function maps) if it makes sense for your\n * project.\n */\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n  case 'INCREMENT':\n    return state + 1\n  case 'DECREMENT':\n    return state - 1\n  default:\n    return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counter)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// However it can also be handy to persist the current state in the localStorage.\n\nstore.subscribe(() =>\n  console.log(store.getState())\n)\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n// 1\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n// 2\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })\n// 1\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called actions. Then you write a special function called a reducer to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\nIf you're coming from Flux, there is a single important difference you need to understand. Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, instead of adding stores, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\nThis architecture might seem like an overkill for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\nLearn Redux from Its Creator\nGetting Started with Redux is a video course consisting of 30 videos narrated by Dan Abramov, author of Redux. It is designed to complement the “Basics” part of the docs while bringing additional insights about immutability, testing, Redux best practices, and using Redux with React. This course is free and will always be.\n\n“Great course on egghead.io by @dan_abramov - instead of just showing you how to use #redux, it also shows how and why redux was built!”Sandrino Di Mattia\n“Plowing through @dan_abramov 'Getting Started with Redux' - its amazing how much simpler concepts get with video.”Chris Dhanaraj\n“This video series on Redux by @dan_abramov on @eggheadio is spectacular!”Eddie Zaneski\n“Come for the name hype. Stay for the rock solid fundamentals. (Thanks, and great job @dan_abramov and @eggheadio!)”Dan\n“This series of videos on Redux by @dan_abramov is repeatedly blowing my mind - gunna do some serious refactoring”Laurence Roberts\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?\nWatch the 30 Free Videos!\nIf you enjoyed my course, consider supporting Egghead by buying a subscription. Subscribers have access to the source code of every example in my videos and tons of advanced lessons on other topics, including JavaScript in depth, React, Angular, and more.

This state can include server responses and cached data, as well as locally created data that has not yet been persisted to the server. UI state is also increasing in complexity, as we need to manage active routes, selected tabs, spinners, pagination controls, and so on.\nManaging this ever-changing state is hard. If a model can update another model, then a view can update a model, which updates another model, and this, in turn, might cause another view to update. At some point, you no longer understand what happens in your app as you have lost control over the when, why, and how of its state. When a system is opaque and non-deterministic, it's hard to reproduce bugs or add new features.\nAs if this wasn't bad enough, consider the new requirements becoming common in front-end product development. As developers, we are expected to handle optimistic updates, server-side rendering, fetching data before performing route transitions, and so on. We find ourselves trying to manage a complexity that we have never had to deal with before, and we inevitably ask the question: is it time to give up? The answer is no.\nThis complexity is difficult to handle as we're mixing two concepts that are very hard for the human mind to reason about: mutation and asynchronicity. I call them Mentos and Coke. Both can be great in separation, but together they create a mess. Libraries like React attempt to solve this problem in the view layer by removing both asynchrony and direct DOM manipulation. However, managing the state of your data is left up to you. This is where Redux enters.\nFollowing in the steps of Flux, CQRS, and Event Sourcing, Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable by imposing certain restrictions on how and when updates can happen. These restrictions are reflected in the three principles of Redux.\n"},"docs/introduction/CoreConcepts.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/CoreConcepts.html","title":"Core Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Core Concepts\nRedux itself is very simple.\nImagine your app’s state is described as a plain object. For example, the state of a todo app might look like this:\n{\n  todos: [{\n    text: 'Eat food',\n    completed: true\n  }, {\n    text: 'Exercise',\n    completed: false\n  }],\n  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'\n}\n\nThis object is like a “model” except that there are no setters. This is so that different parts of the code can’t change the state arbitrarily, causing hard-to-reproduce bugs.\nTo change something in the state, you need to dispatch an action. An action is a plain JavaScript object (notice how we don’t introduce any magic?) that describes what happened. Here are a few example actions:\n{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Go to swimming pool' }\n{ type: 'TOGGLE_TODO', index: 1 }\n{ type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER', filter: 'SHOW_ALL' }\n\nEnforcing that every change is described as an action lets us have a clear understanding of what’s going on in the app. If something changed, we know why it changed. Actions are like breadcrumbs of what has happened.\nFinally, to tie state and actions together, we write a function called a reducer. Again, nothing magical about it—it’s just a function that takes state and action as arguments, and returns the next state of the app.\nIt would be hard to write such a function for a big app, so we write smaller functions managing parts of the state:\nfunction visibilityFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {\n  if (action.type === 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER') {\n    return action.filter\n  } else {\n    return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return state.concat([{ text: action.text, completed: false }])\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      return state.map(\n        (todo, index) =>\n          action.index === index\n            ? { text: todo.text, completed: !todo.completed }\n            : todo\n      )\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nAnd we write another reducer that manages the complete state of our app by calling those two reducers for the corresponding state keys:\nfunction todoApp(state = {}, action) {\n  return {\n    todos: todos(state.todos, action),\n    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action)\n  }\n}\n\nThis is basically the whole idea of Redux. Note that we haven’t used any Redux APIs. It comes with a few utilities to facilitate this pattern, but the main idea is that you describe how your state is updated over time in response to action objects, and 90% of the code you write is just plain JavaScript, with no use of Redux itself, its APIs, or any magic.\n"},"docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html","title":"Three Principles","keywords":"","body":"Three Principles\nRedux can be described in three fundamental principles:\nSingle source of truth\nThe state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.\nThis makes it easy to create universal apps, as the state from your server can be serialized and hydrated into the client with no extra coding effort. A single state tree also makes it easier to debug or inspect an application; it also enables you to persist your app's state in development, for a faster development cycle. Some functionality which has been traditionally difficult to implement - Undo/Redo, for example - can suddenly become trivial to implement, if all of your state is stored in a single tree.\nconsole.log(store.getState())\n\n/* Prints\n{\n  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',\n  todos: [\n    {\n      text: 'Consider using Redux',\n      completed: true,\n    },\n    {\n      text: 'Keep all state in a single tree',\n      completed: false\n    }\n  ]\n}\n*/\n\nState is read-only\nThe only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.\nThis ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state. Instead, they express an intent to transform the state. Because all changes are centralized and happen one by one in a strict order, there are no subtle race conditions to watch out for. As actions are just plain objects, they can be logged, serialized, stored, and later replayed for debugging or testing purposes.\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'COMPLETE_TODO',\n  index: 1\n})\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',\n  filter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'\n})\n\nChanges are made with pure functions\nTo specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.\nReducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state. Remember to return new state objects, instead of mutating the previous state. You can start with a single reducer, and as your app grows, split it off into smaller reducers that manage specific parts of the state tree. Because reducers are just functions, you can control the order in which they are called, pass additional data, or even make reusable reducers for common tasks such as pagination.\nfunction visibilityFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER':\n      return action.filter\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        {\n          text: action.text,\n          completed: false\n        }\n      ]\n    case 'COMPLETE_TODO':\n      return state.map((todo, index) => {\n        if (index === action.index) {\n          return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n            completed: true\n          })\n        }\n        return todo\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nimport { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux'\nconst reducer = combineReducers({ visibilityFilter, todos })\nconst store = createStore(reducer)\n\nThat's it! Now you know what Redux is all about.\n"},"docs/introduction/PriorArt.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/PriorArt.html","title":"Prior Art","keywords":"","body":"Prior Art\nRedux has a mixed heritage. It is similar to some patterns and technologies, but is also different from them in important ways. We'll explore some of the similarities and the differences below.\nFlux\nCan Redux be considered a Flux implementation?Yes, and no.\n(Don't worry, Flux creators approve of it, if that's all you wanted to know.)\nRedux was inspired by several important qualities of Flux. Like Flux, Redux prescribes that you concentrate your model update logic in a certain layer of your application (“stores” in Flux, “reducers” in Redux). Instead of letting the application code directly mutate the data, both tell you to describe every mutation as a plain object called an “action”.\nUnlike Flux, Redux does not have the concept of a Dispatcher. This is because it relies on pure functions instead of event emitters, and pure functions are easy to compose and don't need an additional entity managing them. Depending on how you view Flux, you may see this as either a deviation or an implementation detail. Flux has often been described as (state, action) => state. In this sense, Redux is true to the Flux architecture, but makes it simpler thanks to pure functions.\nAnother important difference from Flux is that Redux assumes you never mutate your data. You can use plain objects and arrays for your state just fine, but mutating them inside the reducers is strongly discouraged. You should always return a new object, which is easy with the object spread operator proposal, or with a library like Immutable.\nWhile it is technically possible to write impure reducers that mutate the data for performance corner cases, we actively discourage you from doing this. Development features like time travel, record/replay, or hot reloading will break. Moreover it doesn't seem like immutability poses performance problems in most real apps, because, as Om demonstrates, even if you lose out on object allocation, you still win by avoiding expensive re-renders and re-calculations, as you know exactly what changed thanks to reducer purity.\nElm\nElm is a functional programming language inspired by Haskell and created by Evan Czaplicki. It enforces a “model view update” architecture, where the update has the following signature: (action, state) => state. Elm “updaters” serve the same purpose as reducers in Redux.\nUnlike Redux, Elm is a language, so it is able to benefit from many things like enforced purity, static typing, out of the box immutability, and pattern matching (using the case expression). Even if you don't plan to use Elm, you should read about the Elm architecture, and play with it. There is an interesting JavaScript library playground implementing similar ideas. We should look there for inspiration on Redux! One way that we can get closer to the static typing of Elm is by using a gradual typing solution like Flow.\nImmutable\nImmutable is a JavaScript library implementing persistent data structures. It is performant and has an idiomatic JavaScript API.\nImmutable and most similar libraries are orthogonal to Redux. Feel free to use them together!\nRedux doesn't care how you store the state—it can be a plain object, an Immutable object, or anything else. You'll probably want a (de)serialization mechanism for writing universal apps and hydrating their state from the server, but other than that, you can use any data storage library as long as it supports immutability. For example, it doesn't make sense to use Backbone for Redux state, because Backbone models are mutable.\nNote that, even if your immutable library supports cursors, you shouldn't use them in a Redux app. The whole state tree should be considered read-only, and you should use Redux for updating the state, and subscribing to the updates. Therefore writing via cursor doesn't make sense for Redux. If your only use case for cursors is decoupling the state tree from the UI tree and gradually refining the cursors, you should look at selectors instead. Selectors are composable getter functions. See reselect for a really great and concise implementation of composable selectors.\nBaobab\nBaobab is another popular library implementing immutable API for updating plain JavaScript objects. While you can use it with Redux, there is little benefit in using them together.\nMost of the functionality Baobab provides is related to updating the data with cursors, but Redux enforces that the only way to update the data is to dispatch an action. Therefore they solve the same problem differently, and don't complement each other.\nUnlike Immutable, Baobab doesn't yet implement any special efficient data structures under the hood, so you don't really win anything from using it together with Redux. It's easier to just use plain objects in this case.\nRxJS\nRxJS is a superb way to manage the complexity of asynchronous apps. In fact there is an effort to create a library that models human-computer interaction as interdependent observables.\nDoes it make sense to use Redux together with RxJS? Sure! They work great together. For example, it is easy to expose a Redux store as an observable:\nfunction toObservable(store) {\n  return {\n    subscribe({ next }) {\n      const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => next(store.getState()))\n      next(store.getState())\n      return { unsubscribe }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSimilarly, you can compose different asynchronous streams to turn them into actions before feeding them to store.dispatch().\nThe question is: do you really need Redux if you already use Rx? Maybe not. It's not hard to re-implement Redux in Rx. Some say it's a two-liner using Rx .scan() method. It may very well be!\nIf you're in doubt, check out the Redux source code (there isn't much going on there), as well as its ecosystem (for example, the developer tools). If you don't care too much about it and want to go with the reactive data flow all the way, you might want to explore something like Cycle instead, or even combine it with Redux. Let us know how it goes!\n"},"docs/introduction/LearningResources.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/LearningResources.html","title":"Learning Resources","keywords":"","body":"Learning Resources\nThe Redux docs are intended to teach the basic concepts of Redux, as well as explain key concepts for use in real-world applications.

This course will get you up and running quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build React components and structure applications with Redux.\n\nRedux, by Tyler McGinnis (paid)https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/redux/When learning Redux, you need to learn it in the context of an app big enough to see the benefits. That's why this course is huge. A better name might be 'Real World Redux. If you're sick of \"todo list\" Redux tutorials, you've come to the right place. In this course we'll talk all about what makes Redux special for managing state in your application. We'll build an actual \"real world\" application so you can see how Redux handles edge cases like optimistic updates and error handling. We'll also cover many other technologies that work well with Redux, Firebase, and CSS Modules.\n\nLearn Redux, by Wes Bos (free)https://learnredux.com/A video course that walks through building 'Reduxstagram' — a simple photo app that will simplify the core ideas behind Redux, React Router and React.js\n\n\nMore Resources\n\nReact-Redux Links is a curated list of high-quality articles, tutorials, and related content for React, Redux, ES6, and more.  \nRedux Ecosystem Links is a categorized collection of Redux-related libraries, addons, and utilities.\nAwesome Redux is an extensive list of Redux-related repositories.  \n\n"},"docs/introduction/Ecosystem.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/Ecosystem.html","title":"Ecosystem","keywords":"","body":"Ecosystem\nRedux is a tiny library, but its contracts and APIs are carefully chosen to spawn an ecosystem of tools and extensions, and the community has created a wide variety of helpful addons, libraries, and tools.  You don't need to use any of these addons to use Redux, but they can help make it easier to implement features and solve problems in your application.\nFor an extensive catalog of libraries, addons, and tools related to Redux, check out the Redux Ecosystem Links list. Also, the React/Redux Links list contains tutorials and other useful resources for anyone learning React or Redux.\nThis page lists some of the Redux-related addons that the Redux maintainers have vetted personally, or that have shown widespread adoption in the community. Don't let this discourage you from trying the rest of them! The ecosystem is growing too fast, and we have a limited time to look at everything.

If you've ever built a Flux application, you will feel right at home. If you're new to Flux, it's easy too!\nIn this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a simple Todo app.\n\nActions\nReducers\nStore\nData Flow\nUsage with React\nExample: Todo List\n\n"},"docs/basics/Actions.html":{"url":"docs/basics/Actions.html","title":"Actions","keywords":"","body":"Actions\nFirst, let's define some actions.\nActions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. You send them to the store using store.dispatch().\nHere's an example action which represents adding a new todo item:\nconst ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'\n\n{\n  type: ADD_TODO,\n  text: 'Build my first Redux app'\n}\n\nActions are plain JavaScript objects. Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed. Types should typically be defined as string constants. Once your app is large enough, you may want to move them into a separate module.\nimport { ADD_TODO, REMOVE_TODO } from '../actionTypes'\n\n\nNote on Boilerplate\nYou don't have to define action type constants in a separate file, or even to define them at all. For a small project, it might be easier to just use string literals for action types. However, there are some benefits to explicitly declaring constants in larger codebases. Read Reducing Boilerplate for more practical tips on keeping your codebase clean.\n\nOther than type, the structure of an action object is really up to you. If you're interested, check out Flux Standard Action for recommendations on how actions could be constructed.\nWe'll add one more action type to describe a user ticking off a todo as completed. We refer to a particular todo by index because we store them in an array. In a real app, it is wiser to generate a unique ID every time something new is created.\n{\n  type: TOGGLE_TODO,\n  index: 5\n}\n\nIt's a good idea to pass as little data in each action as possible. For example, it's better to pass index than the whole todo object.\nFinally, we'll add one more action type for changing the currently visible todos.\n{\n  type: SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER,\n  filter: SHOW_COMPLETED\n}\n\nAction Creators\nAction creators are exactly that—functions that create actions. It's easy to conflate the terms “action” and “action creator,” so do your best to use the proper term.\nIn Redux, action creators simply return an action:\nfunction addTodo(text) {\n  return {\n    type: ADD_TODO,\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nThis makes them portable and easy to test.\nIn traditional Flux, action creators often trigger a dispatch when invoked, like so:\nfunction addTodoWithDispatch(text) {\n  const action = {\n    type: ADD_TODO,\n    text\n  }\n  dispatch(action)\n}\n\nIn Redux this is not the case.Instead, to actually initiate a dispatch, pass the result to the dispatch() function:\ndispatch(addTodo(text))\ndispatch(completeTodo(index))\n\nAlternatively, you can create a bound action creator that automatically dispatches:\nconst boundAddTodo = text => dispatch(addTodo(text))\nconst boundCompleteTodo = index => dispatch(completeTodo(index))\n\nNow you'll be able to call them directly:\nboundAddTodo(text)\nboundCompleteTodo(index)\nThe dispatch() function can be accessed directly from the store as store.dispatch(), but more likely you'll access it using a helper like react-redux's connect(). You can use bindActionCreators() to automatically bind many action creators to a dispatch() function.\nAction creators can also be asynchronous and have side-effects. You can read about async actions in the advanced tutorial to learn how to handle AJAX responses and compose action creators into async control flow. Don't skip ahead to async actions until you've completed the basics tutorial, as it covers other important concepts that are prerequisite for the advanced tutorial and async actions.\nSource Code\nactions.js\n/*\n * action types\n */\n\nexport const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'\nexport const TOGGLE_TODO = 'TOGGLE_TODO'\nexport const SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER = 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER'\n\n/*\n * other constants\n */\n\nexport const VisibilityFilters = {\n  SHOW_ALL: 'SHOW_ALL',\n  SHOW_COMPLETED: 'SHOW_COMPLETED',\n  SHOW_ACTIVE: 'SHOW_ACTIVE'\n}\n\n/*\n * action creators\n */\n\nexport function addTodo(text) {\n  return { type: ADD_TODO, text }\n}\n\nexport function toggleTodo(index) {\n  return { type: TOGGLE_TODO, index }\n}\n\nexport function setVisibilityFilter(filter) {\n  return { type: SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER, filter }\n}\n\nNext Steps\nNow let's define some reducers to specify how the state updates when you dispatch these actions!\n"},"docs/basics/Reducers.html":{"url":"docs/basics/Reducers.html","title":"Reducers","keywords":"","body":"Reducers\nReducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. Remember that actions only describe the fact that something happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.\nDesigning the State Shape\nIn Redux, all the application state is stored as a single object. It's a good idea to think of its shape before writing any code. What's the minimal representation of your app's state as an object?\nFor our todo app, we want to store two different things:\n\nThe currently selected visibility filter.\nThe actual list of todos.\n\nYou'll often find that you need to store some data, as well as some UI state, in the state tree. This is fine, but try to keep the data separate from the UI state.\n{\n  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',\n  todos: [\n    {\n      text: 'Consider using Redux',\n      completed: true,\n    },\n    {\n      text: 'Keep all state in a single tree',\n      completed: false\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nNote on Relationships\nIn a more complex app, you're going to want different entities to reference each other. We suggest that you keep your state as normalized as possible, without any nesting. Keep every entity in an object stored with an ID as a key, and use IDs to reference it from other entities, or lists. Think of the app's state as a database. This approach is described in normalizr's documentation in detail. For example, keeping todosById: { id -> todo } and todos: array inside the state would be a better idea in a real app, but we're keeping the example simple.\n\nHandling Actions\nNow that we've decided what our state object looks like, we're ready to write a reducer for it. The reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.\n(previousState, action) => newState\n\nIt's called a reducer because it's the type of function you would pass to Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue). It's very important that the reducer stays pure. Things you should never do inside a reducer:\n\nMutate its arguments;\nPerform side effects like API calls and routing transitions;\nCall non-pure functions, e.g. Date.now() or Math.random().\n\nWe'll explore how to perform side effects in the advanced walkthrough. For now, just remember that the reducer must be pure. Given the same arguments, it should calculate the next state and return it. No surprises. No side effects. No API calls. No mutations. Just a calculation.\nWith this out of the way, let's start writing our reducer by gradually teaching it to understand the actions we defined earlier.\nWe'll start by specifying the initial state. Redux will call our reducer with an undefined state for the first time. This is our chance to return the initial state of our app:\nimport { VisibilityFilters } from './actions'\n\nconst initialState = {\n  visibilityFilter: VisibilityFilters.SHOW_ALL,\n  todos: []\n}\n\nfunction todoApp(state, action) {\n  if (typeof state === 'undefined') {\n    return initialState\n  }\n\n  // For now, don't handle any actions\n  // and just return the state given to us.\n  return state\n}\n\nOne neat trick is to use the ES6 default arguments syntax to write this in a more compact way:\nfunction todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  // For now, don't handle any actions\n  // and just return the state given to us.\n  return state\n}\n\nNow let's handle SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER. All it needs to do is to change visibilityFilter on the state. Easy:\nfunction todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        visibilityFilter: action.filter\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nNote that:\n\nWe don't mutate the state. We create a copy with Object.assign(). Object.assign(state, { visibilityFilter: action.filter }) is also wrong: it will mutate the first argument. You must supply an empty object as the first parameter. You can also enable the object spread operator proposal to write { ...state, ...newState } instead.\n\nWe return the previous state in the default case. It's important to return the previous state for any unknown action.\n\n\n\nNote on Object.assign\nObject.assign() is a part of ES6, and is not supported by older browsers. To support them, you will need to either use a polyfill, a Babel plugin, or a helper from another library like _.assign().\nNote on switch and Boilerplate\nThe switch statement is not the real boilerplate. The real boilerplate of Flux is conceptual: the need to emit an update, the need to register the Store with a Dispatcher, the need for the Store to be an object (and the complications that arise when you want a universal app). Redux solves these problems by using pure reducers instead of event emitters.\nIt's unfortunate that many still choose a framework based on whether it uses switch statements in the documentation. If you don't like switch, you can use a custom createReducer function that accepts a handler map, as shown in “reducing boilerplate”.\n\nHandling More Actions\nWe have two more actions to handle! Just like we did with SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER, we'll import the ADD_TODO and TOGGLE_TODO actions and then extend our reducer to handle ADD_TODO.\nimport {\n  ADD_TODO,\n  TOGGLE_TODO,\n  SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER,\n  VisibilityFilters\n} from './actions'\n\n...\n\nfunction todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        visibilityFilter: action.filter\n      })\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        todos: [\n          ...state.todos,\n          {\n            text: action.text,\n            completed: false\n          }\n        ]\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nJust like before, we never write directly to state or its fields, and instead we return new objects. The new todos is equal to the old todos concatenated with a single new item at the end. The fresh todo was constructed using the data from the action.\nFinally, the implementation of the TOGGLE_TODO handler shouldn't come as a complete surprise:\ncase TOGGLE_TODO:\n  return Object.assign({}, state, {\n    todos: state.todos.map((todo, index) => {\n      if (index === action.index) {\n        return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n          completed: !todo.completed\n        })\n      }\n      return todo\n    })\n  })\n\nBecause we want to update a specific item in the array without resorting to mutations, we have to create a new array with the same items except the item at the index. If you find yourself often writing such operations, it's a good idea to use a helper like immutability-helper, updeep, or even a library like Immutable that has native support for deep updates. Just remember to never assign to anything inside the state unless you clone it first.\nSplitting Reducers\nHere is our code so far. It is rather verbose:\nfunction todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        visibilityFilter: action.filter\n      })\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        todos: [\n          ...state.todos,\n          {\n            text: action.text,\n            completed: false\n          }\n        ]\n      })\n    case TOGGLE_TODO:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        todos: state.todos.map((todo, index) => {\n          if (index === action.index) {\n            return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n              completed: !todo.completed\n            })\n          }\n          return todo\n        })\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nIs there a way to make it easier to comprehend? It seems like todos and visibilityFilter are updated completely independently. Sometimes state fields depend on one another and more consideration is required, but in our case we can easily split updating todos into a separate function:\nfunction todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        {\n          text: action.text,\n          completed: false\n        }\n      ]\n    case TOGGLE_TODO:\n      return state.map((todo, index) => {\n        if (index === action.index) {\n          return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n            completed: !todo.completed\n          })\n        }\n        return todo\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        visibilityFilter: action.filter\n      })\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        todos: todos(state.todos, action)\n      })\n    case TOGGLE_TODO:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        todos: todos(state.todos, action)\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nNote that todos also accepts state—but it's an array! Now todoApp just gives it the slice of the state to manage, and todos knows how to update just that slice. This is called reducer composition, and it's the fundamental pattern of building Redux apps.\nLet's explore reducer composition more. Can we also extract a reducer managing just visibilityFilter? We can.\nBelow our imports, let's use ES6 Object Destructuring to declare SHOW_ALL:\nconst { SHOW_ALL } = VisibilityFilters\n\nThen:\nfunction visibilityFilter(state = SHOW_ALL, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return action.filter\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can rewrite the main reducer as a function that calls the reducers managing parts of the state, and combines them into a single object. It also doesn't need to know the complete initial state anymore. It's enough that the child reducers return their initial state when given undefined at first.\nfunction todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        {\n          text: action.text,\n          completed: false\n        }\n      ]\n    case TOGGLE_TODO:\n      return state.map((todo, index) => {\n        if (index === action.index) {\n          return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n            completed: !todo.completed\n          })\n        }\n        return todo\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction visibilityFilter(state = SHOW_ALL, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return action.filter\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction todoApp(state = {}, action) {\n  return {\n    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action),\n    todos: todos(state.todos, action)\n  }\n}\n\nNote that each of these reducers is managing its own part of the global state. The state parameter is different for every reducer, and corresponds to the part of the state it manages.\nThis is already looking good! When the app is larger, we can split the reducers into separate files and keep them completely independent and managing different data domains.\nFinally, Redux provides a utility called combineReducers() that does the same boilerplate logic that the todoApp above currently does. With its help, we can rewrite todoApp like this:\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux'\n\nconst todoApp = combineReducers({\n  visibilityFilter,\n  todos\n})\n\nexport default todoApp\n\nNote that this is equivalent to:\nexport default function todoApp(state = {}, action) {\n  return {\n    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action),\n    todos: todos(state.todos, action)\n  }\n}\n\nYou could also give them different keys, or call functions differently. These two ways to write a combined reducer are equivalent:\nconst reducer = combineReducers({\n  a: doSomethingWithA,\n  b: processB,\n  c: c\n})\n\nfunction reducer(state = {}, action) {\n  return {\n    a: doSomethingWithA(state.a, action),\n    b: processB(state.b, action),\n    c: c(state.c, action)\n  }\n}\n\nAll combineReducers() does is generate a function that calls your reducers with the slices of state selected according to their keys, and combining their results into a single object again. It's not magic. And like other reducers, combineReducers() does not create a new object if all of the reducers provided to it do not change state.\n\nNote for ES6 Savvy Users\nBecause combineReducers expects an object, we can put all top-level reducers into a separate file, export each reducer function, and use import * as reducers to get them as an object with their names as the keys:\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux'\nimport * as reducers from './reducers'\n\nconst todoApp = combineReducers(reducers)\n\nBecause import * is still new syntax, we don't use it anymore in the documentation to avoid confusion, but you may encounter it in some community examples.\n\nSource Code\nreducers.js\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux'\nimport {\n  ADD_TODO,\n  TOGGLE_TODO,\n  SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER,\n  VisibilityFilters\n} from './actions'\nconst { SHOW_ALL } = VisibilityFilters\n\nfunction visibilityFilter(state = SHOW_ALL, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return action.filter\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        {\n          text: action.text,\n          completed: false\n        }\n      ]\n    case TOGGLE_TODO:\n      return state.map((todo, index) => {\n        if (index === action.index) {\n          return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n            completed: !todo.completed\n          })\n        }\n        return todo\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nconst todoApp = combineReducers({\n  visibilityFilter,\n  todos\n})\n\nexport default todoApp\n\nNext Steps\nNext, we'll explore how to create a Redux store that holds the state and takes care of calling your reducer when you dispatch an action.\n"},"docs/basics/Store.html":{"url":"docs/basics/Store.html","title":"Store","keywords":"","body":"Store\nIn the previous sections, we defined the actions that represent the facts about “what happened” and the reducers that update the state according to those actions.\nThe Store is the object that brings them together. The store has the following responsibilities:\n\nHolds application state;\nAllows access to state via getState();\nAllows state to be updated via dispatch(action);\nRegisters listeners via subscribe(listener);\nHandles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).\n\nIt's important to note that you'll only have a single store in a Redux application. When you want to split your data handling logic, you'll use reducer composition instead of many stores.\nIt's easy to create a store if you have a reducer. In the previous section, we used combineReducers() to combine several reducers into one. We will now import it, and pass it to createStore().\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport todoApp from './reducers'\nlet store = createStore(todoApp)\n\nYou may optionally specify the initial state as the second argument to createStore(). This is useful for hydrating the state of the client to match the state of a Redux application running on the server.\nlet store = createStore(todoApp, window.STATE_FROM_SERVER)\n\nDispatching Actions\nNow that we have created a store, let's verify our program works! Even without any UI, we can already test the update logic.\nimport {\n  addTodo,\n  toggleTodo,\n  setVisibilityFilter,\n  VisibilityFilters\n} from './actions'\n\n// Log the initial state\nconsole.log(store.getState())\n\n// Every time the state changes, log it\n// Note that subscribe() returns a function for unregistering the listener\nconst unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() =>\n  console.log(store.getState())\n)\n\n// Dispatch some actions\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('Learn about actions'))\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('Learn about reducers'))\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('Learn about store'))\nstore.dispatch(toggleTodo(0))\nstore.dispatch(toggleTodo(1))\nstore.dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(VisibilityFilters.SHOW_COMPLETED))\n\n// Stop listening to state updates\nunsubscribe()\n\nYou can see how this causes the state held by the store to change:\n\nWe specified the behavior of our app before we even started writing the UI. We won't do this in this tutorial, but at this point you can write tests for your reducers and action creators. You won't need to mock anything because they are just pure functions. Call them, and make assertions on what they return.\nSource Code\nindex.js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport todoApp from './reducers'\n\nlet store = createStore(todoApp)\n\nNext Steps\nBefore creating a UI for our todo app, we will take a detour to see how the data flows in a Redux application.\n"},"docs/basics/DataFlow.html":{"url":"docs/basics/DataFlow.html","title":"Data Flow","keywords":"","body":"Data Flow\nRedux architecture revolves around a strict unidirectional data flow.\nThis means that all data in an application follows the same lifecycle pattern, making the logic of your app more predictable and easier to understand. It also encourages data normalization, so that you don't end up with multiple, independent copies of the same data that are unaware of one another.\nIf you're still not convinced, read Motivation and The Case for Flux for a compelling argument in favor of unidirectional data flow. Although Redux is not exactly Flux, it shares the same key benefits.\nThe data lifecycle in any Redux app follows these 4 steps:\n\nYou call store.dispatch(action).\nAn action is a plain object describing what happened. For example:\n { type: 'LIKE_ARTICLE', articleId: 42 }\n { type: 'FETCH_USER_SUCCESS', response: { id: 3, name: 'Mary' } }\n { type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Read the Redux docs.' }\n\nThink of an action as a very brief snippet of news. “Mary liked article 42.” or “‘Read the Redux docs.' was added to the list of todos.”\nYou can call store.dispatch(action) from anywhere in your app, including components and XHR callbacks, or even at scheduled intervals.\n\nThe Redux store calls the reducer function you gave it.\nThe store will pass two arguments to the reducer: the current state tree and the action. For example, in the todo app, the root reducer might receive something like this:\n // The current application state (list of todos and chosen filter)\n let previousState = {\n   visibleTodoFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',\n   todos: [\n     {\n       text: 'Read the docs.',\n       complete: false\n     }\n   ]\n }\n\n // The action being performed (adding a todo)\n let action = {\n   type: 'ADD_TODO',\n   text: 'Understand the flow.'\n }\n\n // Your reducer returns the next application state\n let nextState = todoApp(previousState, action)\n\nNote that a reducer is a pure function. It only computes the next state. It should be completely predictable: calling it with the same inputs many times should produce the same outputs. It shouldn't perform any side effects like API calls or router transitions. These should happen before an action is dispatched.\n\nThe root reducer may combine the output of multiple reducers into a single state tree.\nHow you structure the root reducer is completely up to you. Redux ships with a combineReducers() helper function, useful for “splitting” the root reducer into separate functions that each manage one branch of the state tree.\nHere's how combineReducers() works. Let's say you have two reducers, one for a list of todos, and another for the currently selected filter setting:\n function todos(state = [], action) {\n   // Somehow calculate it...\n   return nextState\n }\n\n function visibleTodoFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {\n   // Somehow calculate it...\n   return nextState\n }\n\n let todoApp = combineReducers({\n   todos,\n   visibleTodoFilter\n })\n\nWhen you emit an action, todoApp returned by combineReducers will call both reducers:\n let nextTodos = todos(state.todos, action)\n let nextVisibleTodoFilter = visibleTodoFilter(state.visibleTodoFilter, action)\n\nIt will then combine both sets of results into a single state tree:\n return {\n   todos: nextTodos,\n   visibleTodoFilter: nextVisibleTodoFilter\n }\n\nWhile combineReducers() is a handy helper utility, you don't have to use it; feel free to write your own root reducer!\n\nThe Redux store saves the complete state tree returned by the root reducer.\nThis new tree is now the next state of your app! Every listener registered with store.subscribe(listener) will now be invoked; listeners may call store.getState() to get the current state.\nNow, the UI can be updated to reflect the new state. If you use bindings like React Redux, this is the point at which component.setState(newState) is called.\n\n\nNext Steps\nNow that you know how Redux works, let's connect it to a React app.\n\nNote for Advanced Users\nIf you're already familiar with the basic concepts and have previously completed this tutorial, don't forget to check out async flow in the advanced tutorial to learn how middleware transforms async actions before they reach the reducer.\n\n"},"docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html":{"url":"docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html","title":"Usage with React","keywords":"","body":"Usage with React\nFrom the very beginning, we need to stress that Redux has no relation to React. You can write Redux apps with React, Angular, Ember, jQuery, or vanilla JavaScript.\nThat said, Redux works especially well with libraries like React and Deku because they let you describe UI as a function of state, and Redux emits state updates in response to actions.\nWe will use React to build our simple todo app.\nInstalling React Redux\nReact bindings are not included in Redux by default. You need to install them explicitly:\nnpm install --save react-redux\nIf you don't use npm, you may grab the latest UMD build from unpkg (either a development or a production build). The UMD build exports a global called window.ReactRedux if you add it to your page via a  tag.\nPresentational and Container Components\nReact bindings for Redux embrace the idea of separating presentational and container components. If you're not familiar with these terms, read about them first, and then come back. They are important, so we'll wait!\nFinished reading the article? Let's recount their differences:\n\n    \n        \n            \n            Presentational Components\n            Container Components\n        \n    \n    \n        \n          Purpose\n          How things look (markup, styles)\n          How things work (data fetching, state updates)\n        \n        \n          Aware of Redux\n          No\n          Yes\n        \n        \n          To read data\n          Read data from props\n          Subscribe to Redux state\n        \n        \n          To change data\n          Invoke callbacks from props\n          Dispatch Redux actions\n        \n        \n          Are written\n          By hand\n          Usually generated by React Redux\n        \n    \n\n\nMost of the components we'll write will be presentational, but we'll need to generate a few container components to connect them to the Redux store. This and the design brief below do not imply container components must be near the top of the component tree. If a container component becomes too complex (i.e. it has heavily nested presentational components with countless callbacks being passed down), introduce another container within the component tree as noted in the FAQ.\nTechnically you could write the container components by hand using store.subscribe(). We don't advise you to do this because React Redux makes many performance optimizations that are hard to do by hand. For this reason, rather than write container components, we will generate them using the connect() function provided by React Redux, as you will see below.\nDesigning Component Hierarchy\nRemember how we designed the shape of the root state object? It's time we design the UI hierarchy to match it. This is not a Redux-specific task. Thinking in React is a great tutorial that explains the process.\nOur design brief is simple. We want to show a list of todo items. On click, a todo item is crossed out as completed. We want to show a field where the user may add a new todo. In the footer, we want to show a toggle to show all, only completed, or only active todos.\nDesigning Presentational Components\nI see the following presentational components and their props emerge from this brief:\n\nTodoList is a list showing visible todos.\ntodos: Array is an array of todo items with { id, text, completed } shape.\nonTodoClick(id: number) is a callback to invoke when a todo is clicked.\n\n\nTodo is a single todo item.\ntext: string is the text to show.\ncompleted: boolean is whether the todo should appear crossed out.\nonClick() is a callback to invoke when the todo is clicked.\n\n\nLink is a link with a callback.\nonClick() is a callback to invoke when the link is clicked.\n\n\nFooter is where we let the user change currently visible todos.\nApp is the root component that renders everything else.\n\nThey describe the look but don't know where the data comes from, or how to change it. They only render what's given to them. If you migrate from Redux to something else, you'll be able to keep all these components exactly the same. They have no dependency on Redux.\nDesigning Container Components\nWe will also need some container components to connect the presentational components to Redux. For example, the presentational TodoList component needs a container like VisibleTodoList that subscribes to the Redux store and knows how to apply the current visibility filter. To change the visibility filter, we will provide a FilterLink container component that renders a Link that dispatches an appropriate action on click:\n\nVisibleTodoList filters the todos according to the current visibility filter and renders a TodoList.\nFilterLink gets the current visibility filter and renders a Link.\nfilter: string is the visibility filter it represents.\n\n\n\nDesigning Other Components\nSometimes it's hard to tell if some component should be a presentational component or a container. For example, sometimes form and function are really coupled together, such as in case of this tiny component:\n\nAddTodo is an input field with an “Add” button\n\nTechnically we could split it into two components but it might be too early at this stage. It's fine to mix presentation and logic in a component that is very small. As it grows, it will be more obvious how to split it, so we'll leave it mixed.\nImplementing Components\nLet's write the components! We begin with the presentational components so we don't need to think about binding to Redux yet.\nImplementing Presentational Components\nThese are all normal React components, so we won't examine them in detail. We write functional stateless components unless we need to use local state or the lifecycle methods. This doesn't mean that presentational components have to be functions—it's just easier to define them this way. If and when you need to add local state, lifecycle methods, or performance optimizations, you can convert them to classes.\ncomponents/Todo.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types'\n\nconst Todo = ({ onClick, completed, text }) => (\n  \n    {text}\n  \n)\n\nTodo.propTypes = {\n  onClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n  completed: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,\n  text: PropTypes.string.isRequired\n}\n\nexport default Todo\n\ncomponents/TodoList.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types'\nimport Todo from './Todo'\n\nconst TodoList = ({ todos, onTodoClick }) => (\n  \n    {todos.map((todo, index) => (\n       onTodoClick(index)} />\n    ))}\n  \n)\n\nTodoList.propTypes = {\n  todos: PropTypes.arrayOf(\n    PropTypes.shape({\n      id: PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n      completed: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,\n      text: PropTypes.string.isRequired\n    }).isRequired\n  ).isRequired,\n  onTodoClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired\n}\n\nexport default TodoList\n\ncomponents/Link.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types'\n\nconst Link = ({ active, children, onClick }) => {\n  if (active) {\n    return {children}\n  }\n\n  return (\n     {\n        e.preventDefault()\n        onClick()\n      }}\n    >\n      {children}\n    \n  )\n}\n\nLink.propTypes = {\n  active: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,\n  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,\n  onClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired\n}\n\nexport default Link\n\ncomponents/Footer.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport FilterLink from '../containers/FilterLink'\n\nconst Footer = () => (\n  \n    Show:\n    {' '}\n    \n      All\n    \n    {', '}\n    \n      Active\n    \n    {', '}\n    \n      Completed\n    \n  \n)\n\nexport default Footer\n\nImplementing Container Components\nNow it's time to hook up those presentational components to Redux by creating some containers. Technically, a container component is just a React component that uses store.subscribe() to read a part of the Redux state tree and supply props to a presentational component it renders. You could write a container component by hand, but we suggest instead generating container components with the React Redux library's connect() function, which provides many useful optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders. (One result of this is that you shouldn't have to worry about the React performance suggestion of implementing shouldComponentUpdate yourself.)\nTo use connect(), you need to define a special function called mapStateToProps that tells how to transform the current Redux store state into the props you want to pass to a presentational component you are wrapping. For example, VisibleTodoList needs to calculate todos to pass to the TodoList, so we define a function that filters the state.todos according to the state.visibilityFilter, and use it in its mapStateToProps:\nconst getVisibleTodos = (todos, filter) => {\n  switch (filter) {\n    case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n      return todos.filter(t => t.completed)\n    case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n      return todos.filter(t => !t.completed)\n    case 'SHOW_ALL':\n    default:\n      return todos\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapStateToProps = state => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)\n  }\n}\n\nIn addition to reading the state, container components can dispatch actions. In a similar fashion, you can define a function called mapDispatchToProps() that receives the dispatch() method and returns callback props that you want to inject into the presentational component. For example, we want the VisibleTodoList to inject a prop called onTodoClick into the TodoList component, and we want onTodoClick to dispatch a TOGGLE_TODO action:\nconst mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: id => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nFinally, we create the VisibleTodoList by calling connect() and passing these two functions:\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\n\nThese are the basics of the React Redux API, but there are a few shortcuts and power options so we encourage you to check out its documentation in detail. In case you are worried about mapStateToProps creating new objects too often, you might want to learn about computing derived data with reselect.\nFind the rest of the container components defined below:\ncontainers/FilterLink.js\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { setVisibilityFilter } from '../actions'\nimport Link from '../components/Link'\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {\n  return {\n    active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => {\n  return {\n    onClick: () => {\n      dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst FilterLink = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(Link)\n\nexport default FilterLink\n\ncontainers/VisibleTodoList.js\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '../actions'\nimport TodoList from '../components/TodoList'\n\nconst getVisibleTodos = (todos, filter) => {\n  switch (filter) {\n    case 'SHOW_ALL':\n      return todos\n    case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n      return todos.filter(t => t.completed)\n    case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n      return todos.filter(t => !t.completed)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapStateToProps = state => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: id => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\n\nImplementing Other Components\ncontainers/AddTodo.js\nRecall as mentioned previously, both the presentation and logic for the AddTodo component are mixed into a single definition.\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { addTodo } from '../actions'\n\nlet AddTodo = ({ dispatch }) => {\n  let input\n\n  return (\n    \n       {\n          e.preventDefault()\n          if (!input.value.trim()) {\n            return\n          }\n          dispatch(addTodo(input.value))\n          input.value = ''\n        }}\n      >\n         {\n            input = node\n          }}\n        />\n        \n          Add Todo\n        \n      \n    \n  )\n}\nAddTodo = connect()(AddTodo)\n\nexport default AddTodo\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the ref attribute, please read this documentation to familiarize yourself with the recommended use of this attribute.\nTying the containers together within a component\ncomponents/App.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Footer from './Footer'\nimport AddTodo from '../containers/AddTodo'\nimport VisibleTodoList from '../containers/VisibleTodoList'\n\nconst App = () => (\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n)\n\nexport default App\n\nPassing the Store\nAll container components need access to the Redux store so they can subscribe to it. One option would be to pass it as a prop to every container component. However it gets tedious, as you have to wire store even through presentational components just because they happen to render a container deep in the component tree.\nThe option we recommend is to use a special React Redux component called  to magically make the store available to all container components in the application without passing it explicitly. You only need to use it once when you render the root component:\nindex.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { render } from 'react-dom'\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport todoApp from './reducers'\nimport App from './components/App'\n\nlet store = createStore(todoApp)\n\nrender(\n  \n    \n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\n\nNext Steps\nRead the complete source code for this tutorial to better internalize the knowledge you have gained.

It was fully synchronous. Every time an action was dispatched, the state was updated immediately.\nIn this guide, we will build a different, asynchronous application. It will use the Reddit API to show the current headlines for a selected subreddit. How does asynchronicity fit into Redux flow?\nActions\nWhen you call an asynchronous API, there are two crucial moments in time: the moment you start the call, and the moment when you receive an answer (or a timeout).\nEach of these two moments usually require a change in the application state; to do that, you need to dispatch normal actions that will be processed by reducers synchronously. Usually, for any API request you'll want to dispatch at least three different kinds of actions:\n\nAn action informing the reducers that the request began.\nThe reducers may handle this action by toggling an isFetching flag in the state. This way the UI knows it's time to show a spinner.\n\nAn action informing the reducers that the request finished successfully.\nThe reducers may handle this action by merging the new data into the state they manage and resetting isFetching. The UI would hide the spinner, and display the fetched data.\n\nAn action informing the reducers that the request failed.\nThe reducers may handle this action by resetting isFetching. Additionally, some reducers may want to store the error message so the UI can display it.\n\n\nYou may use a dedicated status field in your actions:\n{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS' }\n{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS', status: 'error', error: 'Oops' }\n{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS', status: 'success', response: { ... } }\n\nOr you can define separate types for them:\n{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_REQUEST' }\n{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_FAILURE', error: 'Oops' }\n{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_SUCCESS', response: { ... } }\n\nChoosing whether to use a single action type with flags, or multiple action types, is up to you. It's a convention you need to decide with your team. Multiple types leave less room for a mistake, but this is not an issue if you generate action creators and reducers with a helper library like redux-actions.\nWhatever convention you choose, stick with it throughout the application.We'll use separate types in this tutorial.\nSynchronous Action Creators\nLet's start by defining the several synchronous action types and action creators we need in our example app. Here, the user can select a subreddit to display:\nactions.js (Synchronous)\nexport const SELECT_SUBREDDIT = 'SELECT_SUBREDDIT'\n\nexport function selectSubreddit(subreddit) {\n  return {\n    type: SELECT_SUBREDDIT,\n    subreddit\n  }\n}\n\nThey can also press a “refresh” button to update it:\nexport const INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT = 'INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT'\n\nexport function invalidateSubreddit(subreddit) {\n  return {\n    type: INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT,\n    subreddit\n  }\n}\n\nThese were the actions governed by the user interaction. We will also have another kind of action, governed by the network requests. We will see how to dispatch them later, but for now, we just want to define them.\nWhen it's time to fetch the posts for some subreddit, we will dispatch a REQUEST_POSTS action:\nexport const REQUEST_POSTS = 'REQUEST_POSTS'\n\nfunction requestPosts(subreddit) {\n  return {\n    type: REQUEST_POSTS,\n    subreddit\n  }\n}\n\nIt is important for it to be separate from SELECT_SUBREDDIT or INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT. While they may occur one after another, as the app grows more complex, you might want to fetch some data independently of the user action (for example, to prefetch the most popular subreddits, or to refresh stale data once in a while). You may also want to fetch in response to a route change, so it's not wise to couple fetching to some particular UI event early on.\nFinally, when the network request comes through, we will dispatch RECEIVE_POSTS:\nexport const RECEIVE_POSTS = 'RECEIVE_POSTS'\n\nfunction receivePosts(subreddit, json) {\n  return {\n    type: RECEIVE_POSTS,\n    subreddit,\n    posts: json.data.children.map(child => child.data),\n    receivedAt: Date.now()\n  }\n}\n\nThis is all we need to know for now. The particular mechanism to dispatch these actions together with network requests will be discussed later.\n\nNote on Error Handling\nIn a real app, you'd also want to dispatch an action on request failure. We won't implement error handling in this tutorial, but the real world example shows one of the possible approaches.\n\nDesigning the State Shape\nJust like in the basic tutorial, you'll need to design the shape of your application's state before rushing into the implementation. With asynchronous code, there is more state to take care of, so we need to think it through.\nThis part is often confusing to beginners, because it is not immediately clear what information describes the state of an asynchronous application, and how to organize it in a single tree.\nWe'll start with the most common use case: lists. Web applications often show lists of things. For example, a list of posts, or a list of friends. You'll need to figure out what sorts of lists your app can show. You want to store them separately in the state, because this way you can cache them and only fetch again if necessary.\nHere's what the state shape for our “Reddit headlines” app might look like:\n{\n  selectedSubreddit: 'frontend',\n  postsBySubreddit: {\n    frontend: {\n      isFetching: true,\n      didInvalidate: false,\n      items: []\n    },\n    reactjs: {\n      isFetching: false,\n      didInvalidate: false,\n      lastUpdated: 1439478405547,\n      items: [\n        {\n          id: 42,\n          title: 'Confusion about Flux and Relay'\n        },\n        {\n          id: 500,\n          title: 'Creating a Simple Application Using React JS and Flux Architecture'\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThere are a few important bits here:\n\nWe store each subreddit's information separately so we can cache every subreddit. When the user switches between them the second time, the update will be instant, and we won't need to refetch unless we want to. Don't worry about all these items being in memory: unless you're dealing with tens of thousands of items, and your user rarely closes the tab, you won't need any sort of cleanup.\n\nFor every list of items, you'll want to store isFetching to show a spinner, didInvalidate so you can later toggle it when the data is stale, lastUpdated so you know when it was fetched the last time, and the items themselves. In a real app, you'll also want to store pagination state like fetchedPageCount and nextPageUrl.\n\n\n\nNote on Nested Entities\nIn this example, we store the received items together with the pagination information. However, this approach won't work well if you have nested entities referencing each other, or if you let the user edit items. Imagine the user wants to edit a fetched post, but this post is duplicated in several places in the state tree. This would be really painful to implement.\nIf you have nested entities, or if you let users edit received entities, you should keep them separately in the state as if it was a database. In pagination information, you would only refer to them by their IDs. This lets you always keep them up to date. The real world example shows this approach, together with normalizr to normalize the nested API responses. With this approach, your state might look like this:\n{\n  selectedSubreddit: 'frontend',\n  entities: {\n    users: {\n      2: {\n        id: 2,\n        name: 'Andrew'\n      }\n    },\n    posts: {\n      42: {\n        id: 42,\n        title: 'Confusion about Flux and Relay',\n        author: 2\n      },\n      100: {\n        id: 100,\n        title: 'Creating a Simple Application Using React JS and Flux Architecture',\n        author: 2\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  postsBySubreddit: {\n    frontend: {\n      isFetching: true,\n      didInvalidate: false,\n      items: []\n    },\n    reactjs: {\n      isFetching: false,\n      didInvalidate: false,\n      lastUpdated: 1439478405547,\n      items: [ 42, 100 ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn this guide, we won't normalize entities, but it's something you should consider for a more dynamic application.\n\nHandling Actions\nBefore going into the details of dispatching actions together with network requests, we will write the reducers for the actions we defined above.\n\nNote on Reducer Composition\nHere, we assume that you understand reducer composition with combineReducers(), as described in the Splitting Reducers section on the basics guide. If you don't, please read it first.\n\nreducers.js\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux'\nimport {\n  SELECT_SUBREDDIT,\n  INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT,\n  REQUEST_POSTS,\n  RECEIVE_POSTS\n} from '../actions'\n\nfunction selectedSubreddit(state = 'reactjs', action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SELECT_SUBREDDIT:\n      return action.subreddit\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction posts(\n  state = {\n    isFetching: false,\n    didInvalidate: false,\n    items: []\n  },\n  action\n) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        didInvalidate: true\n      })\n    case REQUEST_POSTS:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        isFetching: true,\n        didInvalidate: false\n      })\n    case RECEIVE_POSTS:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        isFetching: false,\n        didInvalidate: false,\n        items: action.posts,\n        lastUpdated: action.receivedAt\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction postsBySubreddit(state = {}, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT:\n    case RECEIVE_POSTS:\n    case REQUEST_POSTS:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        [action.subreddit]: posts(state[action.subreddit], action)\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n  postsBySubreddit,\n  selectedSubreddit\n})\n\nexport default rootReducer\n\nIn this code, there are two interesting parts:\n\nWe use ES6 computed property syntax so we can update state[action.subreddit] with Object.assign() in a concise way. This:\nreturn Object.assign({}, state, {\n  [action.subreddit]: posts(state[action.subreddit], action)\n})\n\nis equivalent to this:\nlet nextState = {}\nnextState[action.subreddit] = posts(state[action.subreddit], action)\nreturn Object.assign({}, state, nextState)\n\n\nWe extracted posts(state, action) that manages the state of a specific post list. This is just reducer composition! It is our choice how to split the reducer into smaller reducers, and in this case, we're delegating updating items inside an object to a posts reducer. The real world example goes even further, showing how to create a reducer factory for parameterized pagination reducers.\n\nRemember that reducers are just functions, so you can use functional composition and higher-order functions as much as you feel comfortable.\nAsync Action Creators\nFinally, how do we use the synchronous action creators we defined earlier together with network requests? The standard way to do it with Redux is to use the Redux Thunk middleware. It comes in a separate package called redux-thunk. We'll explain how middleware works in general later; for now, there is just one important thing you need to know: by using this specific middleware, an action creator can return a function instead of an action object. This way, the action creator becomes a thunk.\nWhen an action creator returns a function, that function will get executed by the Redux Thunk middleware. This function doesn't need to be pure; it is thus allowed to have side effects, including executing asynchronous API calls. The function can also dispatch actions—like those synchronous actions we defined earlier.\nWe can still define these special thunk action creators inside our actions.js file:\nactions.js (Asynchronous)\nimport fetch from 'cross-fetch'\n\nexport const REQUEST_POSTS = 'REQUEST_POSTS'\nfunction requestPosts(subreddit) {\n  return {\n    type: REQUEST_POSTS,\n    subreddit\n  }\n}\n\nexport const RECEIVE_POSTS = 'RECEIVE_POSTS'\nfunction receivePosts(subreddit, json) {\n  return {\n    type: RECEIVE_POSTS,\n    subreddit,\n    posts: json.data.children.map(child => child.data),\n    receivedAt: Date.now()\n  }\n}\n\nexport const INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT = 'INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT'\nexport function invalidateSubreddit(subreddit) {\n  return {\n    type: INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT,\n    subreddit\n  }\n}\n\n// Meet our first thunk action creator!\n// Though its insides are different, you would use it just like any other action creator:\n// store.dispatch(fetchPosts('reactjs'))\n\nexport function fetchPosts(subreddit) {\n  // Thunk middleware knows how to handle functions.\n  // It passes the dispatch method as an argument to the function,\n  // thus making it able to dispatch actions itself.\n\n  return function (dispatch) {\n    // First dispatch: the app state is updated to inform\n    // that the API call is starting.\n\n    dispatch(requestPosts(subreddit))\n\n    // The function called by the thunk middleware can return a value,\n    // that is passed on as the return value of the dispatch method.\n\n    // In this case, we return a promise to wait for.\n    // This is not required by thunk middleware, but it is convenient for us.\n\n    return fetch(`https://www.reddit.com/r/${subreddit}.json`)\n      .then(\n        response => response.json(),\n        // Do not use catch, because that will also catch\n        // any errors in the dispatch and resulting render,\n        // causing a loop of 'Unexpected batch number' errors.\n        // https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6895\n        error => console.log('An error occurred.', error)\n      )\n      .then(json =>\n        // We can dispatch many times!\n        // Here, we update the app state with the results of the API call.\n\n        dispatch(receivePosts(subreddit, json))\n      )\n  }\n}\n\n\nNote on fetch\nWe use fetch API in the examples. It is a new API for making network requests that replaces XMLHttpRequest for most common needs. Because most browsers don't yet support it natively, we suggest that you use cross-fetch library:\n// Do this in every file where you use `fetch`\nimport fetch from 'cross-fetch'\n\nInternally, it uses whatwg-fetch polyfill on the client, and node-fetch on the server, so you won't need to change API calls if you change your app to be universal.\nBe aware that any fetch polyfill assumes a Promise polyfill is already present. The easiest way to ensure you have a Promise polyfill is to enable Babel's ES6 polyfill in your entry point before any other code runs:\n// Do this once before any other code in your app\nimport 'babel-polyfill'\n\n\nHow do we include the Redux Thunk middleware in the dispatch mechanism? We use the applyMiddleware() store enhancer from Redux, as shown below:\nindex.js\nimport thunkMiddleware from 'redux-thunk'\nimport { createLogger } from 'redux-logger'\nimport { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport { selectSubreddit, fetchPosts } from './actions'\nimport rootReducer from './reducers'\n\nconst loggerMiddleware = createLogger()\n\nconst store = createStore(\n  rootReducer,\n  applyMiddleware(\n    thunkMiddleware, // lets us dispatch() functions\n    loggerMiddleware // neat middleware that logs actions\n  )\n)\n\nstore.dispatch(selectSubreddit('reactjs'))\nstore\n  .dispatch(fetchPosts('reactjs'))\n  .then(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\nThe nice thing about thunks is that they can dispatch results of each other:\nactions.js (with fetch)\nimport fetch from 'cross-fetch'\n\nexport const REQUEST_POSTS = 'REQUEST_POSTS'\nfunction requestPosts(subreddit) {\n  return {\n    type: REQUEST_POSTS,\n    subreddit\n  }\n}\n\nexport const RECEIVE_POSTS = 'RECEIVE_POSTS'\nfunction receivePosts(subreddit, json) {\n  return {\n    type: RECEIVE_POSTS,\n    subreddit,\n    posts: json.data.children.map(child => child.data),\n    receivedAt: Date.now()\n  }\n}\n\nexport const INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT = 'INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT'\nexport function invalidateSubreddit(subreddit) {\n  return {\n    type: INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT,\n    subreddit\n  }\n}\n\nfunction fetchPosts(subreddit) {\n  return dispatch => {\n    dispatch(requestPosts(subreddit))\n    return fetch(`https://www.reddit.com/r/${subreddit}.json`)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(json => dispatch(receivePosts(subreddit, json)))\n  }\n}\n\nfunction shouldFetchPosts(state, subreddit) {\n  const posts = state.postsBySubreddit[subreddit]\n  if (!posts) {\n    return true\n  } else if (posts.isFetching) {\n    return false\n  } else {\n    return posts.didInvalidate\n  }\n}\n\nexport function fetchPostsIfNeeded(subreddit) {\n  // Note that the function also receives getState()\n  // which lets you choose what to dispatch next.\n\n  // This is useful for avoiding a network request if\n  // a cached value is already available.\n\n  return (dispatch, getState) => {\n    if (shouldFetchPosts(getState(), subreddit)) {\n      // Dispatch a thunk from thunk!\n      return dispatch(fetchPosts(subreddit))\n    } else {\n      // Let the calling code know there's nothing to wait for.\n      return Promise.resolve()\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis lets us write more sophisticated async control flow gradually, while the consuming code can stay pretty much the same:\nindex.js\nstore\n  .dispatch(fetchPostsIfNeeded('reactjs'))\n  .then(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n\nNote about Server Rendering\nAsync action creators are especially convenient for server rendering. You can create a store, dispatch a single async action creator that dispatches other async action creators to fetch data for a whole section of your app, and only render after the Promise it returns, completes. Then your store will already be hydrated with the state you need before rendering.\n\nThunk middleware isn't the only way to orchestrate asynchronous actions in Redux:\n\nYou can use redux-promise or redux-promise-middleware to dispatch Promises instead of functions.\nYou can use redux-observable to dispatch Observables.\nYou can use the redux-saga middleware to build more complex asynchronous actions.\nYou can use the redux-pack middleware to dispatch promise-based asynchronous actions.\nYou can even write a custom middleware to describe calls to your API, like the real world example does.\n\nIt is up to you to try a few options, choose a convention you like, and follow it, whether with, or without the middleware.\nConnecting to UI\nDispatching async actions is no different from dispatching synchronous actions, so we won't discuss this in detail. See Usage with React for an introduction into using Redux from React components. See Example: Reddit API for the complete source code discussed in this example.\nNext Steps\nRead Async Flow to recap how async actions fit into the Redux flow.\n"},"docs/advanced/AsyncFlow.html":{"url":"docs/advanced/AsyncFlow.html","title":"Async Flow","keywords":"","body":"Async Flow\nWithout middleware, Redux store only supports synchronous data flow. This is what you get by default with createStore().\nYou may enhance createStore() with applyMiddleware(). It is not required, but it lets you express asynchronous actions in a convenient way.\nAsynchronous middleware like redux-thunk or redux-promise wraps the store's dispatch() method and allows you to dispatch something other than actions, for example, functions or Promises. Any middleware you use can then interpret anything you dispatch, and in turn, can pass actions to the next middleware in the chain. For example, a Promise middleware can intercept Promises and dispatch a pair of begin/end actions asynchronously in response to each Promise.\nWhen the last middleware in the chain dispatches an action, it has to be a plain object. This is when the synchronous Redux data flow takes place.\nCheck out the full source code for the async example.\nNext Steps\nNow you saw an example of what middleware can do in Redux, it's time to learn how it actually works, and how you can create your own. Go on to the next detailed section about Middleware. \n"},"docs/advanced/Middleware.html":{"url":"docs/advanced/Middleware.html","title":"Middleware","keywords":"","body":"Middleware\nYou've seen middleware in action in the Async Actions example. If you've used server-side libraries like Express and Koa, you were also probably already familiar with the concept of middleware. In these frameworks, middleware is some code you can put between the framework receiving a request, and the framework generating a response. For example, Express or Koa middleware may add CORS headers, logging, compression, and more. The best feature of middleware is that it's composable in a chain. You can use multiple independent third-party middleware in a single project.\nRedux middleware solves different problems than Express or Koa middleware, but in a conceptually similar way. It provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more.\nThis article is divided into an in-depth intro to help you grok the concept, and a few practical examples to show the power of middleware at the very end. You may find it helpful to switch back and forth between them, as you flip between feeling bored and inspired.\nUnderstanding Middleware\nWhile middleware can be used for a variety of things, including asynchronous API calls, it's really important that you understand where it comes from. We'll guide you through the thought process leading to middleware, by using logging and crash reporting as examples.\nProblem: Logging\nOne of the benefits of Redux is that it makes state changes predictable and transparent. Every time an action is dispatched, the new state is computed and saved. The state cannot change by itself, it can only change as a consequence of a specific action.\nWouldn't it be nice if we logged every action that happens in the app, together with the state computed after it? When something goes wrong, we can look back at our log, and figure out which action corrupted the state.\n\nHow do we approach this with Redux?\nAttempt #1: Logging Manually\nThe most naïve solution is just to log the action and the next state yourself every time you call store.dispatch(action). It's not really a solution, but just a first step towards understanding the problem.\n\nNote\nIf you're using react-redux or similar bindings, you likely won't have direct access to the store instance in your components. For the next few paragraphs, just assume you pass the store down explicitly.\n\nSay, you call this when creating a todo:\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('Use Redux'))\n\nTo log the action and state, you can change it to something like this:\nlet action = addTodo('Use Redux')\n\nconsole.log('dispatching', action)\nstore.dispatch(action)\nconsole.log('next state', store.getState())\n\nThis produces the desired effect, but you wouldn't want to do it every time.\nAttempt #2: Wrapping Dispatch\nYou can extract logging into a function:\nfunction dispatchAndLog(store, action) {\n  console.log('dispatching', action)\n  store.dispatch(action)\n  console.log('next state', store.getState())\n}\n\nYou can then use it everywhere instead of store.dispatch():\ndispatchAndLog(store, addTodo('Use Redux'))\n\nWe could end this here, but it's not very convenient to import a special function every time.\nAttempt #3: Monkeypatching Dispatch\nWhat if we just replace the dispatch function on the store instance? The Redux store is just a plain object with a few methods, and we're writing JavaScript, so we can just monkeypatch the dispatch implementation:\nlet next = store.dispatch\nstore.dispatch = function dispatchAndLog(action) {\n  console.log('dispatching', action)\n  let result = next(action)\n  console.log('next state', store.getState())\n  return result\n}\n\nThis is already closer to what we want!  No matter where we dispatch an action, it is guaranteed to be logged. Monkeypatching never feels right, but we can live with this for now.\nProblem: Crash Reporting\nWhat if we want to apply more than one such transformation to dispatch?\nA different useful transformation that comes to my mind is reporting JavaScript errors in production. The global window.onerror event is not reliable because it doesn't provide stack information in some older browsers, which is crucial to understand why an error is happening.\nWouldn't it be useful if, any time an error is thrown as a result of dispatching an action, we would send it to a crash reporting service like Sentry with the stack trace, the action that caused the error, and the current state? This way it's much easier to reproduce the error in development.\nHowever, it is important that we keep logging and crash reporting separate. Ideally we want them to be different modules, potentially in different packages. Otherwise we can't have an ecosystem of such utilities. (Hint: we're slowly getting to what middleware is!)\nIf logging and crash reporting are separate utilities, they might look like this:\nfunction patchStoreToAddLogging(store) {\n  let next = store.dispatch\n  store.dispatch = function dispatchAndLog(action) {\n    console.log('dispatching', action)\n    let result = next(action)\n    console.log('next state', store.getState())\n    return result\n  }\n}\n\nfunction patchStoreToAddCrashReporting(store) {\n  let next = store.dispatch\n  store.dispatch = function dispatchAndReportErrors(action) {\n    try {\n      return next(action)\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error('Caught an exception!', err)\n      Raven.captureException(err, {\n        extra: {\n          action,\n          state: store.getState()\n        }\n      })\n      throw err\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIf these functions are published as separate modules, we can later use them to patch our store:\npatchStoreToAddLogging(store)\npatchStoreToAddCrashReporting(store)\n\nStill, this isn't nice.\nAttempt #4: Hiding Monkeypatching\nMonkeypatching is a hack. “Replace any method you like”, what kind of API is that? Let's figure out the essence of it instead. Previously, our functions replaced store.dispatch. What if they returned the new dispatch function instead?\nfunction logger(store) {\n  let next = store.dispatch\n\n  // Previously:\n  // store.dispatch = function dispatchAndLog(action) {\n\n  return function dispatchAndLog(action) {\n    console.log('dispatching', action)\n    let result = next(action)\n    console.log('next state', store.getState())\n    return result\n  }\n}\n\nWe could provide a helper inside Redux that would apply the actual monkeypatching as an implementation detail:\nfunction applyMiddlewareByMonkeypatching(store, middlewares) {\n  middlewares = middlewares.slice()\n  middlewares.reverse()\n\n  // Transform dispatch function with each middleware.\n  middlewares.forEach(middleware =>\n    store.dispatch = middleware(store)\n  )\n}\n\nWe could use it to apply multiple middleware like this:\napplyMiddlewareByMonkeypatching(store, [logger, crashReporter])\n\nHowever, it is still monkeypatching.The fact that we hide it inside the library doesn't alter this fact.\nAttempt #5: Removing Monkeypatching\nWhy do we even overwrite dispatch? Of course, to be able to call it later, but there's also another reason: so that every middleware can access (and call) the previously wrapped store.dispatch:\nfunction logger(store) {\n  // Must point to the function returned by the previous middleware:\n  let next = store.dispatch\n\n  return function dispatchAndLog(action) {\n    console.log('dispatching', action)\n    let result = next(action)\n    console.log('next state', store.getState())\n    return result\n  }\n}\n\nIt is essential to chaining middleware!\nIf applyMiddlewareByMonkeypatching doesn't assign store.dispatch immediately after processing the first middleware, store.dispatch will keep pointing to the original dispatch function. Then the second middleware will also be bound to the original dispatch function.\nBut there's also a different way to enable chaining. The middleware could accept the next() dispatch function as a parameter instead of reading it from the store instance.\nfunction logger(store) {\n  return function wrapDispatchToAddLogging(next) {\n    return function dispatchAndLog(action) {\n      console.log('dispatching', action)\n      let result = next(action)\n      console.log('next state', store.getState())\n      return result\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIt's a “we need to go deeper” kind of moment, so it might take a while for this to make sense. The function cascade feels intimidating. ES6 arrow functions make this currying easier on eyes:\nconst logger = store => next => action => {\n  console.log('dispatching', action)\n  let result = next(action)\n  console.log('next state', store.getState())\n  return result\n}\n\nconst crashReporter = store => next => action => {\n  try {\n    return next(action)\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Caught an exception!', err)\n    Raven.captureException(err, {\n      extra: {\n        action,\n        state: store.getState()\n      }\n    })\n    throw err\n  }\n}\n\nThis is exactly what Redux middleware looks like.\nNow middleware takes the next() dispatch function, and returns a dispatch function, which in turn serves as next() to the middleware to the left, and so on. It's still useful to have access to some store methods like getState(), so store stays available as the top-level argument.\nAttempt #6: Naïvely Applying the Middleware\nInstead of applyMiddlewareByMonkeypatching(), we could write applyMiddleware() that first obtains the final, fully wrapped dispatch() function, and returns a copy of the store using it:\n// Warning: Naïve implementation!\n// That's *not* Redux API.\nfunction applyMiddleware(store, middlewares) {\n  middlewares = middlewares.slice()\n  middlewares.reverse()\n  let dispatch = store.dispatch\n  middlewares.forEach(middleware =>\n    dispatch = middleware(store)(dispatch)\n  )\n  return Object.assign({}, store, { dispatch })\n}\n\nThe implementation of applyMiddleware() that ships with Redux is similar, but different in three important aspects:\n\nIt only exposes a subset of the store API to the middleware: dispatch(action) and getState().\n\nIt does a bit of trickery to make sure that if you call store.dispatch(action) from your middleware instead of next(action), the action will actually travel the whole middleware chain again, including the current middleware. This is useful for asynchronous middleware, as we have seen previously. There is one caveat when calling dispatch during setup, described below.\n\nTo ensure that you may only apply middleware once, it operates on createStore() rather than on store itself. Instead of (store, middlewares) => store, its signature is (...middlewares) => (createStore) => createStore.\n\n\nBecause it is cumbersome to apply functions to createStore() before using it, createStore() accepts an optional last argument to specify such functions.\nCaveat: Dispatching During Setup\nWhile applyMiddleware executes and sets up your middleware, the store.dispatch function will point to the vanilla version provided by createStore. Dispatching would result in no other middleware being applied. If you are expecting an interaction with another middleware during setup, you will probably be disappointed. Because of this unexpected behavior, applyMiddleware will throw an error if you try to dispatch an action before the set up completes. Instead, you should either communicate directly with that other middleware via a common object (for an API-calling middleware, this may be your API client object) or waiting until after the middleware is constructed with a callback. \nThe Final Approach\nGiven this middleware we just wrote:\nconst logger = store => next => action => {\n  console.log('dispatching', action)\n  let result = next(action)\n  console.log('next state', store.getState())\n  return result\n}\n\nconst crashReporter = store => next => action => {\n  try {\n    return next(action)\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Caught an exception!', err)\n    Raven.captureException(err, {\n      extra: {\n        action,\n        state: store.getState()\n      }\n    })\n    throw err\n  }\n}\n\nHere's how to apply it to a Redux store:\nimport { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\n\nlet todoApp = combineReducers(reducers)\nlet store = createStore(\n  todoApp,\n  // applyMiddleware() tells createStore() how to handle middleware\n  applyMiddleware(logger, crashReporter)\n)\n\nThat's it!

Redux will be the source of truth for your data and React Router will be the source of truth for your URL. In most of the cases, it is fine to have them separate unless you need to time travel and rewind actions that trigger a URL change.\nInstalling React Router\nreact-router-dom is available on npm . This guides assumes you are using react-router-dom@^4.1.1.\nnpm install --save react-router-dom\nConfiguring the Fallback URL\nBefore integrating React Router, we need to configure our development server. Indeed, our development server may be unaware of the declared routes in React Router configuration. For example, if you access /todos and refresh, your development server needs to be instructed to serve index.html because it is a single-page app. Here's how to enable this with popular development servers.\n\nNote on Create React App\nIf you are using Create React App, you won't need to configure a fallback URL, it is automatically done.\n\nConfiguring Express\nIf you are serving your index.html from Express:\napp.get('/*', (req, res) => {\n  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'))\n})\n\nConfiguring WebpackDevServer\nIf you are serving your index.html from WebpackDevServer:\nYou can add to your webpack.config.dev.js:\ndevServer: {\n  historyApiFallback: true\n}\n\nConnecting React Router with Redux App\nAlong this chapter, we will be using the Todos example. We recommend you to clone it while reading this chapter.\nFirst we will need to import  and  from React Router. Here's how to do it:\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom'\n\nIn a React app, usually you would wrap  in  so that when the URL changes,  will match a branch of its routes, and render their configured components.  is used to declaratively map routes to your application's component hierarchy. You would declare in path the path used in the URL and in component the single component to be rendered when the route matches the URL.\nconst Root = () => (\n  \n    \n  \n)\n\nHowever, in our Redux App we will still need .  is the higher-order component provided by React Redux that lets you bind Redux to React (see Usage with React).\nWe will then import the  from React Redux:\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\n\nWe will wrap  in  so that route handlers can get access to the store.\nconst Root = ({ store }) => (\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n)\n\nNow the  component will be rendered if the URL matches '/'. Additionally, we will add the optional :filter? parameter to /, because we will need it further on when we try to read the parameter :filter from the URL.\n\n\ncomponents/Root.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types'\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport App from './App'\n\nconst Root = ({ store }) => (\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n)\n\nRoot.propTypes = {\n  store: PropTypes.object.isRequired\n}\n\nexport default Root\n\nWe will also need to refactor index.js to render the  component to the DOM.\nindex.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { render } from 'react-dom'\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport todoApp from './reducers'\nimport Root from './components/Root'\n\nlet store = createStore(todoApp)\n\nrender(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\n\nNavigating with React Router\nReact Router comes with a  component that lets you navigate around your application. If you want to add some styles, react-router-dom has another special  called , which accepts styling props. For instance, the activeStyle property lets us apply a style on the active state.\nIn our example, we can wrap  with a new container component  so as to dynamically change the URL.\ncontainers/FilterLink.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'\n\nconst FilterLink = ({ filter, children }) => (\n  \n    {children}\n  \n)\n\nexport default FilterLink\n\ncomponents/Footer.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport FilterLink from '../containers/FilterLink'\n\nconst Footer = () => (\n  \n    Show:\n    {' '}\n    \n      All\n    \n    {', '}\n    \n      Active\n    \n    {', '}\n    \n      Completed\n    \n  \n)\n\nexport default Footer\n\nNow if you click on  you will see that your URL will change between '/SHOW_COMPLETED', '/SHOW_ACTIVE', and '/'. Even if you are going back with your browser, it will use your browser's history and effectively go to your previous URL.\nReading From the URL\nCurrently, the todo list is not filtered even after the URL changed. This is because we are filtering from 's mapStateToProps() is still bound to the state and not to the URL. mapStateToProps has an optional second argument ownProps that is an object with every props passed to \ncontainers/VisibleTodoList.js\nconst mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, ownProps.filter) // previously was getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)\n  }\n}\n\nRight now we are not passing anything to  so ownProps is an empty object. To filter our todos according to the URL, we want to pass the URL params to .\nWhen previously we wrote:  , it made available inside App a params property.\nparams property is an object with every param specified in the url with the match object. e.g: match.params will be equal to { filter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED' } if we are navigating to localhost:3000/SHOW_COMPLETED. We can now read the URL from .\nNote that we are using ES6 destructuring on the properties to pass in params to .\ncomponents/App.js\nconst App = ({ match: { params } }) => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nNext Steps\nNow that you know how to do basic routing, you can learn more about React Router API\n\nNote About Other Routing Libraries\nRedux Router is an experimental library, it lets you keep entirely the state of your URL inside your redux store. It has the same API with React Router API but has a smaller community support than react-router.\nReact Router Redux creates a binding between your redux app and react-router and it keeps them in sync. Without this binding, you will not be able to rewind the actions with Time Travel. Unless you need this, React Router and Redux can operate completely apart.\n\n"},"docs/advanced/ExampleRedditAPI.html":{"url":"docs/advanced/ExampleRedditAPI.html","title":"Example: Reddit

Redux","keywords":"","body":"Migrating to Redux\nRedux is not a monolithic framework, but a set of contracts and a few functions that make them work together. The majority of your “Redux code” will not even use Redux APIs, as most of the time you'll be writing functions. \nThis makes it easy to migrate both to and from Redux.We don't want to lock you in!\nFrom Flux\nReducers capture “the essence” of Flux Stores, so it's possible to gradually migrate an existing Flux project towards Redux, whether you are using Flummox, Alt, traditional Flux, or any other Flux library.\nYour process will look like this:\n\nCreate a function called createFluxStore(reducer) that creates a Flux store compatible with your existing app from a reducer function. Internally it might look similar to createStore (source) implementation from Redux. Its dispatch handler should just call the reducer for any action, store the next state, and emit change.\n\nThis allows you to gradually rewrite every Flux Store in your app as a reducer, but still export createFluxStore(reducer) so the rest of your app is not aware that this is happening and sees the Flux stores.\n\nAs you rewrite your Stores, you will find that you need to avoid certain Flux anti-patterns such as fetching API inside the Store, or triggering actions inside the Stores. Your Flux code will be easier to follow once you port it to be based on reducers!\n\nWhen you have ported all of your Flux Stores to be implemented on top of reducers, you can replace the Flux library with a single Redux store, and combine those reducers you already have into one using combineReducers(reducers).\n\nNow all that's left to do is to port the UI to use react-redux or equivalent.\n\nFinally, you might want to begin using some Redux idioms like middleware to further simplify your asynchronous code.\n\n\nFrom Backbone\nBackbone's model layer is quite different from Redux, so we don't suggest mixing them. If possible, it is best that you rewrite your app's model layer from scratch instead of connecting Backbone to Redux. However, if a rewrite is not feasible, you may use backbone-redux to migrate gradually, and keep the Redux store in sync with Backbone models and collections.\nIf your Backbone codebase is too big for a quick rewrite or you don't want to manage interactions between store and models, use backbone-redux-migrator to help your two codebases coexist while keeping healthy separation. Once your rewrite finishes, Backbone code can be discarded and your Redux application can work on its own once you configure router.\n"},"docs/recipes/UsingObjectSpreadOperator.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/UsingObjectSpreadOperator.html","title":"Using Object Spread Operator","keywords":"","body":"Using Object Spread Operator\nSince one of the core tenets of Redux is to never mutate state, you'll often find yourself using Object.assign() to create\ncopies of objects with new or updated values. For example, in the todoApp below Object.assign() is used to return a new\nstate object with an updated visibilityFilter property:\nfunction todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        visibilityFilter: action.filter\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nWhile effective, using Object.assign() can quickly make simple reducers difficult to read given its rather verbose syntax.\nAn alternative approach is to use the object spread syntax proposed for the next versions of JavaScript which lets you use the spread (...) operator to copy enumerable properties from one object to another in a more succinct way. The object spread operator is conceptually similar to the ES6 array spread operator. We\ncan simplify the todoApp example above by using the object spread syntax:\nfunction todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\n      return { ...state, visibilityFilter: action.filter }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nThe advantage of using the object spread syntax becomes more apparent when you're composing complex objects. Below getAddedIds maps an array of id values to an array of objects with values returned from getProduct and getQuantity.\nreturn getAddedIds(state.cart).map(id =>\n  Object.assign({}, getProduct(state.products, id), {\n    quantity: getQuantity(state.cart, id)\n  })\n)\n\nObject spread lets us simplify the above map call to:\nreturn getAddedIds(state.cart).map(id => ({\n  ...getProduct(state.products, id),\n  quantity: getQuantity(state.cart, id)\n}))\n\nSince the object spread syntax is still a Stage 3 proposal for ECMAScript you'll need to use a transpiler such as Babel to use it in production. You should use the env preset, install babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread and add it individually to the plugins array in your .babelrc.\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"@babel/preset-env\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\"transform-object-rest-spread\"]\n}\n\nNote that this is still an experimental language feature proposal so it may change in the future. Nevertheless some large projects such as React Native already use it extensively so it is safe to say that there will be a good automated migration path if it changes.\n"},"docs/recipes/ReducingBoilerplate.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/ReducingBoilerplate.html","title":"Reducing Boilerplate","keywords":"","body":"Reducing Boilerplate\nRedux is in part inspired by Flux, and the most common complaint about Flux is how it makes you write a lot of boilerplate. In this recipe, we will consider how Redux lets us choose how verbose we'd like our code to be, depending on personal style, team preferences, longer term maintainability, and so on.\nActions\nActions are plain objects describing what happened in the app, and serve as the sole way to describe an intention to mutate the data. It's important that actions being objects you have to dispatch is not boilerplate, but one of the fundamental design choices of Redux.\nThere are frameworks claiming to be similar to Flux, but without a concept of action objects. In terms of being predictable, this is a step backwards from Flux or Redux. If there are no serializable plain object actions, it is impossible to record and replay user sessions, or to implement hot reloading with time travel. If you'd rather modify data directly, you don't need Redux.\nActions look like this:\n{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Use Redux' }\n{ type: 'REMOVE_TODO', id: 42 }\n{ type: 'LOAD_ARTICLE', response: { ... } }\n\nIt is a common convention that actions have a constant type that helps reducers (or Stores in Flux) identify them. We recommend that you use strings and not Symbols for action types, because strings are serializable, and by using Symbols you make recording and replaying harder than it needs to be.\nIn Flux, it is traditionally thought that you would define every action type as a string constant:\nconst ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'\nconst REMOVE_TODO = 'REMOVE_TODO'\nconst LOAD_ARTICLE = 'LOAD_ARTICLE'\n\nWhy is this beneficial? It is often claimed that constants are unnecessary, and for small projects, this might be correct. For larger projects, there are some benefits to defining action types as constants:\n\nIt helps keep the naming consistent because all action types are gathered in a single place.\nSometimes you want to see all existing actions before working on a new feature. It may be that the action you need was already added by somebody on the team, but you didn't know.\nThe list of action types that were added, removed, and changed in a Pull Request helps everyone on the team keep track of scope and implementation of new features.\nIf you make a typo when importing an action constant, you will get undefined. Redux will immediately throw when dispatching such an action, and you'll find the mistake sooner.\n\nIt is up to you to choose the conventions for your project. You may start by using inline strings, and later transition to constants, and maybe later group them into a single file. Redux does not have any opinion here, so use your best judgment.\nAction Creators\nIt is another common convention that, instead of creating action objects inline in the places where you dispatch the actions, you would create functions generating them.\nFor example, instead of calling dispatch with an object literal:\n// somewhere in an event handler\ndispatch({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  text: 'Use Redux'\n})\n\nYou might write an action creator in a separate file, and import it into your component:\nactionCreators.js\nexport function addTodo(text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nAddTodo.js\nimport { addTodo } from './actionCreators'\n\n// somewhere in an event handler\ndispatch(addTodo('Use Redux'))\n\nAction creators have often been criticized as boilerplate. Well, you don't have to write them! You can use object literals if you feel this better suits your project. There are, however, some benefits for writing action creators you should know about.\nLet's say a designer comes back to us after reviewing our prototype, and tells us that we need to allow three todos maximum. We can enforce this by rewriting our action creator to a callback form with redux-thunk middleware and adding an early exit:\nfunction addTodoWithoutCheck(text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nexport function addTodo(text) {\n  // This form is allowed by Redux Thunk middleware\n  // described below in “Async Action Creators” section.\n  return function (dispatch, getState) {\n    if (getState().todos.length === 3) {\n      // Exit early\n      return\n    }\n    dispatch(addTodoWithoutCheck(text))\n  }\n}\n\nWe just modified how the addTodo action creator behaves, completely invisible to the calling code. We don't have to worry about looking at each place where todos are being added, to make sure they have this check. Action creators let you decouple additional logic around dispatching an action, from the actual components emitting those actions. It's very handy when the application is under heavy development, and the requirements change often.\nGenerating Action Creators\nSome frameworks like Flummox generate action type constants automatically from the action creator function definitions. The idea is that you don't need to both define ADD_TODO constant and addTodo() action creator. Under the hood, such solutions still generate action type constants, but they're created implicitly so it's a level of indirection and can cause confusion. We recommend creating your action type constants explicitly.\nWriting simple action creators can be tiresome and often ends up generating redundant boilerplate code:\nexport function addTodo(text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nexport function editTodo(id, text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'EDIT_TODO',\n    id,\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nexport function removeTodo(id) {\n  return {\n    type: 'REMOVE_TODO',\n    id\n  }\n}\n\nYou can always write a function that generates an action creator:\nfunction makeActionCreator(type, ...argNames) {\n  return function (...args) {\n    let action = { type }\n    argNames.forEach((arg, index) => {\n      action[argNames[index]] = args[index]\n    })\n    return action\n  }\n}\n\nconst ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'\nconst EDIT_TODO = 'EDIT_TODO'\nconst REMOVE_TODO = 'REMOVE_TODO'\n\nexport const addTodo = makeActionCreator(ADD_TODO, 'text')\nexport const editTodo = makeActionCreator(EDIT_TODO, 'id', 'text')\nexport const removeTodo = makeActionCreator(REMOVE_TODO, 'id')\n\nThere are also utility libraries to aid in generating action creators, such as redux-act and redux-actions. These can help reduce boilerplate code and enforce adherence to standards such as Flux Standard Action (FSA).\nAsync Action Creators\nMiddleware lets you inject custom logic that interprets every action object before it is dispatched. Async actions are the most common use case for middleware.\nWithout any middleware, dispatch only accepts a plain object, so we have to perform AJAX calls inside our components:\nactionCreators.js\nexport function loadPostsSuccess(userId, response) {\n  return {\n    type: 'LOAD_POSTS_SUCCESS',\n    userId,\n    response\n  }\n}\n\nexport function loadPostsFailure(userId, error) {\n  return {\n    type: 'LOAD_POSTS_FAILURE',\n    userId,\n    error\n  }\n}\n\nexport function loadPostsRequest(userId) {\n  return {\n    type: 'LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST',\n    userId\n  }\n}\n\nUserInfo.js\nimport { Component } from 'react'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport {\n  loadPostsRequest,\n  loadPostsSuccess,\n  loadPostsFailure\n} from './actionCreators'\n\nclass Posts extends Component {\n  loadData(userId) {\n    // Injected into props by React Redux `connect()` call:\n    let { dispatch, posts } = this.props\n\n    if (posts[userId]) {\n      // There is cached data! Don't do anything.\n      return\n    }\n\n    // Reducer can react to this action by setting\n    // `isFetching` and thus letting us show a spinner.\n    dispatch(loadPostsRequest(userId))\n\n    // Reducer can react to these actions by filling the `users`.\n    fetch(`http://myapi.com/users/${userId}/posts`).then(\n      response => dispatch(loadPostsSuccess(userId, response)),\n      error => dispatch(loadPostsFailure(userId, error))\n    )\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.loadData(this.props.userId)\n  }\n\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    if (nextProps.userId !== this.props.userId) {\n      this.loadData(nextProps.userId)\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.props.isFetching) {\n      return Loading...\n    }\n\n    let posts = this.props.posts.map(post =>\n      \n    )\n\n    return {posts}\n  }\n}\n\nexport default connect(state => ({\n  posts: state.posts\n}))(Posts)\n\nHowever, this quickly gets repetitive because different components request data from the same API endpoints. Moreover, we want to reuse some of this logic (e.g., early exit when there is cached data available) from many components.\nMiddleware lets us write more expressive, potentially async action creators. It lets us dispatch something other than plain objects, and interprets the values. For example, middleware can “catch” dispatched Promises and turn them into a pair of request and success/failure actions.\nThe simplest example of middleware is redux-thunk. “Thunk” middleware lets you write action creators as “thunks”, that is, functions returning functions. This inverts the control: you will get dispatch as an argument, so you can write an action creator that dispatches many times.\n\nNote\nThunk middleware is just one example of middleware. Middleware is not about “letting you dispatch functions”. It's about letting you dispatch anything that the particular middleware you use knows how to handle. Thunk middleware adds a specific behavior when you dispatch functions, but it really depends on the middleware you use.\n\nConsider the code above rewritten with redux-thunk:\nactionCreators.js\nexport function loadPosts(userId) {\n  // Interpreted by the thunk middleware:\n  return function (dispatch, getState) {\n    let { posts } = getState()\n    if (posts[userId]) {\n      // There is cached data! Don't do anything.\n      return\n    }\n\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST',\n      userId\n    })\n\n    // Dispatch vanilla actions asynchronously\n    fetch(`http://myapi.com/users/${userId}/posts`).then(\n      response =>\n        dispatch({\n          type: 'LOAD_POSTS_SUCCESS',\n          userId,\n          response\n        }),\n      error =>\n        dispatch({\n          type: 'LOAD_POSTS_FAILURE',\n          userId,\n          error\n        })\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nUserInfo.js\nimport { Component } from 'react'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { loadPosts } from './actionCreators'\n\nclass Posts extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.props.dispatch(loadPosts(this.props.userId))\n  }\n\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    if (nextProps.userId !== this.props.userId) {\n      this.props.dispatch(loadPosts(nextProps.userId))\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.props.isFetching) {\n      return Loading...\n    }\n\n    let posts = this.props.posts.map(post =>\n      \n    )\n\n    return {posts}\n  }\n}\n\nexport default connect(state => ({\n  posts: state.posts\n}))(Posts)\n\nThis is much less typing! If you'd like, you can still have “vanilla” action creators like loadPostsSuccess which you'd use from a container loadPosts action creator.\nFinally, you can write your own middleware. Let's say you want to generalize the pattern above and describe your async action creators like this instead:\nexport function loadPosts(userId) {\n  return {\n    // Types of actions to emit before and after\n    types: ['LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST', 'LOAD_POSTS_SUCCESS', 'LOAD_POSTS_FAILURE'],\n    // Check the cache (optional):\n    shouldCallAPI: state => !state.posts[userId],\n    // Perform the fetching:\n    callAPI: () => fetch(`http://myapi.com/users/${userId}/posts`),\n    // Arguments to inject in begin/end actions\n    payload: { userId }\n  }\n}\n\nThe middleware that interprets such actions could look like this:\nfunction callAPIMiddleware({ dispatch, getState }) {\n  return next => action => {\n    const {\n      types,\n      callAPI,\n      shouldCallAPI = () => true,\n      payload = {}\n    } = action\n\n    if (!types) {\n      // Normal action: pass it on\n      return next(action)\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !Array.isArray(types) ||\n      types.length !== 3 ||\n      !types.every(type => typeof type === 'string')\n    ) {\n      throw new Error('Expected an array of three string types.')\n    }\n\n    if (typeof callAPI !== 'function') {\n      throw new Error('Expected callAPI to be a function.')\n    }\n\n    if (!shouldCallAPI(getState())) {\n      return\n    }\n\n    const [requestType, successType, failureType] = types\n\n    dispatch(\n      Object.assign({}, payload, {\n        type: requestType\n      })\n    )\n\n    return callAPI().then(\n      response =>\n        dispatch(\n          Object.assign({}, payload, {\n            response,\n            type: successType\n          })\n        ),\n      error =>\n        dispatch(\n          Object.assign({}, payload, {\n            error,\n            type: failureType\n          })\n        )\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nAfter passing it once to applyMiddleware(...middlewares), you can write all your API-calling action creators the same way:\nexport function loadPosts(userId) {\n  return {\n    types: ['LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST', 'LOAD_POSTS_SUCCESS', 'LOAD_POSTS_FAILURE'],\n    shouldCallAPI: state => !state.posts[userId],\n    callAPI: () => fetch(`http://myapi.com/users/${userId}/posts`),\n    payload: { userId }\n  }\n}\n\nexport function loadComments(postId) {\n  return {\n    types: [\n      'LOAD_COMMENTS_REQUEST',\n      'LOAD_COMMENTS_SUCCESS',\n      'LOAD_COMMENTS_FAILURE'\n    ],\n    shouldCallAPI: state => !state.comments[postId],\n    callAPI: () => fetch(`http://myapi.com/posts/${postId}/comments`),\n    payload: { postId }\n  }\n}\n\nexport function addComment(postId, message) {\n  return {\n    types: [\n      'ADD_COMMENT_REQUEST',\n      'ADD_COMMENT_SUCCESS',\n      'ADD_COMMENT_FAILURE'\n    ],\n    callAPI: () =>\n      fetch(`http://myapi.com/posts/${postId}/comments`, {\n        method: 'post',\n        headers: {\n          Accept: 'application/json',\n          'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n        },\n        body: JSON.stringify({ message })\n      }),\n    payload: { postId, message }\n  }\n}\n\nReducers\nRedux reduces the boilerplate of Flux stores considerably by describing the update logic as a function. A function is simpler than an object, and much simpler than a class.\nConsider this Flux store:\nlet _todos = []\n\nconst TodoStore = Object.assign({}, EventEmitter.prototype, {\n  getAll() {\n    return _todos\n  }\n})\n\nAppDispatcher.register(function (action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ActionTypes.ADD_TODO:\n      let text = action.text.trim()\n      _todos.push(text)\n      TodoStore.emitChange()\n  }\n})\n\nexport default TodoStore\n\nWith Redux, the same update logic can be described as a reducing function:\nexport function todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ActionTypes.ADD_TODO:\n      let text = action.text.trim()\n      return [...state, text]\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nThe switch statement is not the real boilerplate. The real boilerplate of Flux is conceptual: the need to emit an update, the need to register the Store with a Dispatcher, the need for the Store to be an object (and the complications that arise when you want a universal app).\nIt's unfortunate that many still choose Flux framework based on whether it uses switch statements in the documentation. If you don't like switch, you can solve this with a single function, as we show below.\nGenerating Reducers\nLet's write a function that lets us express reducers as an object mapping from action types to handlers. For example, if we want our todos reducers to be defined like this:\nexport const todos = createReducer([], {\n  [ActionTypes.ADD_TODO](state, action) {\n    let text = action.text.trim()\n    return [...state, text]\n  }\n})\n\nWe can write the following helper to accomplish this:\nfunction createReducer(initialState, handlers) {\n  return function reducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    if (handlers.hasOwnProperty(action.type)) {\n      return handlers[action.type](state, action)\n    } else {\n      return state\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis wasn't difficult, was it? Redux doesn't provide such a helper function by default because there are many ways to write it. Maybe you want it to automatically convert plain JS objects to Immutable objects to hydrate the server state. Maybe you want to merge the returned state with the current state. There may be different approaches to a “catch all” handler. All of this depends on the conventions you choose for your team on a specific project.\nThe Redux reducer API is (state, action) => state, but how you create those reducers is up to you.\n"},"docs/recipes/ServerRendering.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/ServerRendering.html","title":"Server Rendering","keywords":"","body":"Server Rendering\nThe most common use case for server-side rendering is to handle the initial render when a user (or search engine crawler) first requests our app.  When the server receives the request, it renders the required component(s) into an HTML string, and then sends it as a response to the client.  From that point on, the client takes over rendering duties.\nWe will use React in the examples below, but the same techniques can be used with other view frameworks that can render on the server.\nRedux on the Server\nWhen using Redux with server rendering, we must also send the state of our app along in our response, so the client can use it as the initial state. This is important because, if we preload any data before generating the HTML, we want the client to also have access to this data. Otherwise, the markup generated on the client won't match the server markup, and the client would have to load the data again.\nTo send the data down to the client, we need to:\n\ncreate a fresh, new Redux store instance on every request;\noptionally dispatch some actions;\npull the state out of store;\nand then pass the state along to the client.\n\nOn the client side, a new Redux store will be created and initialized with the state provided from the server.Redux's only job on the server side is to provide the initial state of our app.\nSetting Up\nIn the following recipe, we are going to look at how to set up server-side rendering. We'll use the simplistic Counter app as a guide and show how the server can render state ahead of time based on the request.\nInstall Packages\nFor this example, we'll be using Express as a simple web server. We also need to install the React bindings for Redux, since they are not included in Redux by default.\nnpm install --save express react-redux\nThe Server Side\nThe following is the outline for what our server side is going to look like. We are going to set up an Express middleware using app.use to handle all requests that come in to our server. If you're unfamiliar with Express or middleware, just know that our handleRender function will be called every time the server receives a request.\nAdditionally, as we are using ES6 and JSX syntax, we will need to compile with Babel (see this example of a Node Server with Babel) and the React preset.\nserver.js\nimport path from 'path'\nimport Express from 'express'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\nimport counterApp from './reducers'\nimport App from './containers/App'\n\nconst app = Express()\nconst port = 3000\n\n//Serve static files\napp.use('/static', Express.static('static'))\n\n// This is fired every time the server side receives a request\napp.use(handleRender)\n\n// We are going to fill these out in the sections to follow\nfunction handleRender(req, res) { /* ... */ }\nfunction renderFullPage(html, preloadedState) { /* ... */ }\n\napp.listen(port)\n\nHandling the Request\nThe first thing that we need to do on every request is create a new Redux store instance. The only purpose of this store instance is to provide the initial state of our application.\nWhen rendering, we will wrap , our root component, inside a  to make the store available to all components in the component tree, as we saw in Usage with React.\nThe key step in server side rendering is to render the initial HTML of our component before we send it to the client side. To do this, we use ReactDOMServer.renderToString().\nWe then get the initial state from our Redux store using store.getState(). We will see how this is passed along in our renderFullPage function.\nimport { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'\n\nfunction handleRender(req, res) {\n  // Create a new Redux store instance\n  const store = createStore(counterApp)\n\n  // Render the component to a string\n  const html = renderToString(\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n\n  // Grab the initial state from our Redux store\n  const preloadedState = store.getState()\n\n  // Send the rendered page back to the client\n  res.send(renderFullPage(html, preloadedState))\n}\n\nInject Initial Component HTML and State\nThe final step on the server side is to inject our initial component HTML and initial state into a template to be rendered on the client side. To pass along the state, we add a  tag that will attach preloadedState to window.__PRELOADED_STATE__.\nThe preloadedState will then be available on the client side by accessing window.__PRELOADED_STATE__.\nWe also include our bundle file for the client-side application via a script tag. This is whatever output your bundling tool provides for your client entry point. It may be a static file or a URL to a hot reloading development server.\nfunction renderFullPage(html, preloadedState) {\n  return `\n    \n    \n      \n        Redux Universal Example\n      \n      \n        ${html}\n        \n          // WARNING: See the following for security issues around embedding JSON in HTML:\n          // http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/ServerRendering.html#security-considerations\n          window.__PRELOADED_STATE__ = ${JSON.stringify(preloadedState).replace(/\n        \n      \n    \n    `\n}\n\nThe Client Side\nThe client side is very straightforward. All we need to do is grab the initial state from window.__PRELOADED_STATE__, and pass it to our createStore() function as the initial state.\nLet's take a look at our new client file:\nclient.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { hydrate } from 'react-dom'\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\nimport App from './containers/App'\nimport counterApp from './reducers'\n\n// Grab the state from a global variable injected into the server-generated HTML\nconst preloadedState = window.__PRELOADED_STATE__\n\n// Allow the passed state to be garbage-collected\ndelete window.__PRELOADED_STATE__\n\n// Create Redux store with initial state\nconst store = createStore(counterApp, preloadedState)\n\nhydrate(\n  \n    \n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\n\nYou can set up your build tool of choice (Webpack, Browserify, etc.) to compile a bundle file into static/bundle.js.\nWhen the page loads, the bundle file will be started up and ReactDOM.hydrate() will hook into the data-react-id attributes from the server-rendered HTML. This will connect our newly-started React instance to the virtual DOM used on the server. Since we have the same initial state for our Redux store and used the same code for all our view components, the result will be the same real DOM.\nAnd that's it! That is all we need to do to implement server side rendering.\nBut the result is pretty vanilla. It essentially renders a static view from dynamic code. What we need to do next is build an initial state dynamically to allow that rendered view to be dynamic.\nPreparing the Initial State\nBecause the client side executes ongoing code, it can start with an empty initial state and obtain any necessary state on demand and over time. On the server side, rendering is synchronous and we only get one shot to render our view. We need to be able to compile our initial state during the request, which will have to react to input and obtain external state (such as that from an API or database).\nProcessing Request Parameters\nThe only input for server side code is the request made when loading up a page in your app in your browser. You may choose to configure the server during its boot (such as when you are running in a development vs. production environment), but that configuration is static.\nThe request contains information about the URL requested, including any query parameters, which will be useful when using something like React Router. It can also contain headers with inputs like cookies or authorization, or POST body data. Let's see how we can set the initial counter state based on a query parameter.\nserver.js\nimport qs from 'qs' // Add this at the top of the file\nimport { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'\n\nfunction handleRender(req, res) {\n  // Read the counter from the request, if provided\n  const params = qs.parse(req.query)\n  const counter = parseInt(params.counter, 10) || 0\n\n  // Compile an initial state\n  let preloadedState = { counter }\n\n  // Create a new Redux store instance\n  const store = createStore(counterApp, preloadedState)\n\n  // Render the component to a string\n  const html = renderToString(\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n\n  // Grab the initial state from our Redux store\n  const finalState = store.getState()\n\n  // Send the rendered page back to the client\n  res.send(renderFullPage(html, finalState))\n}\n\nThe code reads from the Express Request object passed into our server middleware. The parameter is parsed into a number and then set in the initial state. If you visit http://localhost:3000/?counter=100 in your browser, you'll see the counter starts at 100. In the rendered HTML, you'll see the counter output as 100 and the __PRELOADED_STATE__ variable has the counter set in it.\nAsync State Fetching\nThe most common issue with server side rendering is dealing with state that comes in asynchronously. Rendering on the server is synchronous by nature, so it's necessary to map any asynchronous fetches into a synchronous operation.\nThe easiest way to do this is to pass through some callback back to your synchronous code. In this case, that will be a function that will reference the response object and send back our rendered HTML to the client. Don't worry, it's not as hard as it may sound.\nFor our example, we'll imagine there is an external datastore that contains the counter's initial value (Counter As A Service, or CaaS). We'll make a mock call over to them and build our initial state from the result. We'll start by building out our API call:\napi/counter.js\nfunction getRandomInt(min, max) {\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min\n}\n\nexport function fetchCounter(callback) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    callback(getRandomInt(1, 100))\n  }, 500)\n}\n\nAgain, this is just a mock API, so we use setTimeout to simulate a network request that takes 500 milliseconds to respond (this should be much faster with a real world API). We pass in a callback that returns a random number asynchronously. If you're using a Promise-based API client, then you would issue this callback in your then handler.\nOn the server side, we simply wrap our existing code in the fetchCounter and receive the result in the callback:\nserver.js\n// Add this to our imports\nimport { fetchCounter } from './api/counter'\nimport { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'\n\nfunction handleRender(req, res) {\n  // Query our mock API asynchronously\n  fetchCounter(apiResult => {\n    // Read the counter from the request, if provided\n    const params = qs.parse(req.query)\n    const counter = parseInt(params.counter, 10) || apiResult || 0\n\n    // Compile an initial state\n    let preloadedState = { counter }\n\n    // Create a new Redux store instance\n    const store = createStore(counterApp, preloadedState)\n\n    // Render the component to a string\n    const html = renderToString(\n      \n        \n      \n    )\n\n    // Grab the initial state from our Redux store\n    const finalState = store.getState()\n\n    // Send the rendered page back to the client\n    res.send(renderFullPage(html, finalState))\n  })\n}\n\nBecause we call res.send() inside of the callback, the server will hold open the connection and won't send any data until that callback executes. You'll notice a 500ms delay is now added to each server request as a result of our new API call. A more advanced usage would handle errors in the API gracefully, such as a bad response or timeout.\nSecurity Considerations\nBecause we have introduced more code that relies on user generated content (UGC) and input, we have increased our attack surface area for our application. It is important for any application that you ensure your input is properly sanitized to prevent things like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or code injections.\nIn our example, we take a rudimentary approach to security. When we obtain the parameters from the request, we use parseInt on the counter parameter to ensure this value is a number. If we did not do this, you could easily get dangerous data into the rendered HTML by providing a script tag in the request. That might look like this: ?counter=doSomethingBad();\nFor our simplistic example, coercing our input into a number is sufficiently secure. If you're handling more complex input, such as freeform text, then you should run that input through an appropriate sanitization function, such as validator.js.\nFurthermore, you can add additional layers of security by sanitizing your state output. JSON.stringify can be subject to script injections. To counter this, you can scrub the JSON string of HTML tags and other dangerous characters. This can be done with either a simple text replacement on the string, e.g. JSON.stringify(state).replace(/, or via more sophisticated libraries such as serialize-javascript.\nNext Steps\nYou may want to read Async Actions to learn more about expressing asynchronous flow in Redux with async primitives such as Promises and thunks. Keep in mind that anything you learn there can also be applied to universal rendering.\nIf you use something like React Router, you might also want to express your data fetching dependencies as static fetchData() methods on your route handler components. They may return async actions, so that your handleRender function can match the route to the route handler component classes, dispatch fetchData() result for each of them, and render only after the Promises have resolved. This way the specific API calls required for different routes are colocated with the route handler component definitions. You can also use the same technique on the client side to prevent the router from switching the page until its data has been loaded.\n"},"docs/recipes/WritingTests.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/WritingTests.html","title":"Writing Tests","keywords":"","body":"Writing Tests\nBecause most of the Redux code you write are functions, and many of them are pure, they are easy to test without mocking.\nSetting Up\nWe recommend Jest as the testing engine.\nNote that it runs in a Node environment, so you won't have access to the DOM.\nnpm install --save-dev jest\nTo use it together with Babel, you will need to install babel-jest:\nnpm install --save-dev babel-jest\nand configure it to use babel-preset-env features in .babelrc:\n{\n   \"presets\": [\"@babel/preset-env\"]\n}\n\nThen, add this to scripts in your package.json:\n{\n  ...\n  \"scripts\": {\n    ...\n    \"test\": \"jest\",\n    \"test:watch\": \"npm test -- --watch\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\n\nand run npm test to run it once, or npm run test:watch to test on every file change.\nAction Creators\nIn Redux, action creators are functions which return plain objects. When testing action creators we want to test whether the correct action creator was called and also whether the right action was returned.\nExample\nexport function addTodo(text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    text\n  }\n}\n\ncan be tested like:\nimport * as actions from '../../actions/TodoActions'\nimport * as types from '../../constants/ActionTypes'\n\ndescribe('actions', () => {\n  it('should create an action to add a todo', () => {\n    const text = 'Finish docs'\n    const expectedAction = {\n      type: types.ADD_TODO,\n      text\n    }\n    expect(actions.addTodo(text)).toEqual(expectedAction)\n  })\n})\n\nAsync Action Creators\nFor async action creators using Redux Thunk or other middleware, it's best to completely mock the Redux store for tests. You can apply the middleware to a mock store using redux-mock-store. You can also use fetch-mock to mock the HTTP requests.\nExample\nimport 'cross-fetch/polyfill'\n\nfunction fetchTodosRequest() {\n  return {\n    type: FETCH_TODOS_REQUEST\n  }\n}\n\nfunction fetchTodosSuccess(body) {\n  return {\n    type: FETCH_TODOS_SUCCESS,\n    body\n  }\n}\n\nfunction fetchTodosFailure(ex) {\n  return {\n    type: FETCH_TODOS_FAILURE,\n    ex\n  }\n}\n\nexport function fetchTodos() {\n  return dispatch => {\n    dispatch(fetchTodosRequest())\n    return fetch('http://example.com/todos')\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(body => dispatch(fetchTodosSuccess(body)))\n      .catch(ex => dispatch(fetchTodosFailure(ex)))\n  }\n}\n\ncan be tested like:\nimport configureMockStore from 'redux-mock-store'\nimport thunk from 'redux-thunk'\nimport * as actions from '../../actions/TodoActions'\nimport * as types from '../../constants/ActionTypes'\nimport fetchMock from 'fetch-mock'\nimport expect from 'expect' // You can use any testing library\n\nconst middlewares = [thunk]\nconst mockStore = configureMockStore(middlewares)\n\ndescribe('async actions', () => {\n  afterEach(() => {\n    fetchMock.reset()\n    fetchMock.restore()\n  })\n\n  it('creates FETCH_TODOS_SUCCESS when fetching todos has been done', () => {\n    fetchMock\n      .getOnce('/todos', { body: { todos: ['do something'] }, headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' } })\n\n\n    const expectedActions = [\n      { type: types.FETCH_TODOS_REQUEST },\n      { type: types.FETCH_TODOS_SUCCESS, body: { todos: ['do something'] } }\n    ]\n    const store = mockStore({ todos: [] })\n\n    return store.dispatch(actions.fetchTodos()).then(() => {\n      // return of async actions\n      expect(store.getActions()).toEqual(expectedActions)\n    })\n  })\n})\n\nReducers\nA reducer should return the new state after applying the action to the previous state, and that's the behavior tested below.\nExample\nimport { ADD_TODO } from '../constants/ActionTypes'\n\nconst initialState = [\n  {\n    text: 'Use Redux',\n    completed: false,\n    id: 0\n  }\n]\n\nexport default function todos(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return [\n        {\n          id: state.reduce((maxId, todo) => Math.max(todo.id, maxId), -1) + 1,\n          completed: false,\n          text: action.text\n        },\n        ...state\n      ]\n\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\ncan be tested like:\nimport reducer from '../../reducers/todos'\nimport * as types from '../../constants/ActionTypes'\n\ndescribe('todos reducer', () => {\n  it('should return the initial state', () => {\n    expect(reducer(undefined, {})).toEqual([\n      {\n        text: 'Use Redux',\n        completed: false,\n        id: 0\n      }\n    ])\n  })\n\n  it('should handle ADD_TODO', () => {\n    expect(\n      reducer([], {\n        type: types.ADD_TODO,\n        text: 'Run the tests'\n      })\n    ).toEqual([\n      {\n        text: 'Run the tests',\n        completed: false,\n        id: 0\n      }\n    ])\n\n    expect(\n      reducer(\n        [\n          {\n            text: 'Use Redux',\n            completed: false,\n            id: 0\n          }\n        ],\n        {\n          type: types.ADD_TODO,\n          text: 'Run the tests'\n        }\n      )\n    ).toEqual([\n      {\n        text: 'Run the tests',\n        completed: false,\n        id: 1\n      },\n      {\n        text: 'Use Redux',\n        completed: false,\n        id: 0\n      }\n    ])\n  })\n})\n\nComponents\nA nice thing about React components is that they are usually small and only rely on their props. That makes them easy to test.\nFirst, we will install Enzyme. Enzyme uses the React Test Utilities underneath, but is more convenient, readable, and powerful.\nnpm install --save-dev enzyme\nWe will also need to install Enzyme adapter for our version of React. Enzyme has adapters that provide compatability with React 16.x, React 15.x, React 0.14.x and React 0.13.x. If you are using React 16 you can run:\nnpm install --save-dev enzyme-adapter-react-16\nTo test the components we make a setup() helper that passes the stubbed callbacks as props and renders the component with shallow rendering. This lets individual tests assert on whether the callbacks were called when expected.\nExample\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types'\nimport TodoTextInput from './TodoTextInput'\n\nclass Header extends Component {\n  handleSave(text) {\n    if (text.length !== 0) {\n      this.props.addTodo(text)\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        todos\n        \n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nHeader.propTypes = {\n  addTodo: PropTypes.func.isRequired\n}\n\nexport default Header\n\ncan be tested like:\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Enzyme, { mount } from 'enzyme'\nimport Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';\nimport Header from '../../components/Header'\n\nEnzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });\n\nfunction setup() {\n  const props = {\n    addTodo: jest.fn()\n  }\n\n  const enzymeWrapper = mount()\n\n  return {\n    props,\n    enzymeWrapper\n  }\n}\n\ndescribe('components', () => {\n  describe('Header', () => {\n    it('should render self and subcomponents', () => {\n      const { enzymeWrapper } = setup()\n\n      expect(enzymeWrapper.find('header').hasClass('header')).toBe(true)\n\n      expect(enzymeWrapper.find('h1').text()).toBe('todos')\n\n      const todoInputProps = enzymeWrapper.find('TodoTextInput').props()\n      expect(todoInputProps.newTodo).toBe(true)\n      expect(todoInputProps.placeholder).toEqual('What needs to be done?')\n    })\n\n    it('should call addTodo if length of text is greater than 0', () => {\n      const { enzymeWrapper, props } = setup()\n      const input = enzymeWrapper.find('TodoTextInput')\n      input.props().onSave('')\n      expect(props.addTodo.mock.calls.length).toBe(0)\n      input.props().onSave('Use Redux')\n      expect(props.addTodo.mock.calls.length).toBe(1)\n    })\n  })\n})\n\nConnected Components\nIf you use a library like React Redux, you might be using higher-order components like connect(). This lets you inject Redux state into a regular React component.\nConsider the following App component:\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\nclass App extends Component { /* ... */ }\n\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(App)\n\nIn a unit test, you would normally import the App component like this:\nimport App from './App'\n\nHowever, when you import it, you're actually holding the wrapper component returned by connect(), and not the App component itself. If you want to test its interaction with Redux, this is good news: you can wrap it in a  with a store created specifically for this unit test. But sometimes you want to test just the rendering of the component, without a Redux store.\nIn order to be able to test the App component itself without having to deal with the decorator, we recommend you to also export the undecorated component:\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\n// Use named export for unconnected component (for tests)\nexport class App extends Component { /* ... */ }\n\n// Use default export for the connected component (for app)\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(App)\n\nSince the default export is still the decorated component, the import statement pictured above will work as before so you won't have to change your application code. However, you can now import the undecorated App components in your test file like this:\n// Note the curly braces: grab the named export instead of default export\nimport { App } from './App'\n\nAnd if you need both:\nimport ConnectedApp, { App } from './App'\n\nIn the app itself, you would still import it normally:\nimport App from './App'\n\nYou would only use the named export for tests.\n\nA Note on Mixing ES6 Modules and CommonJS\nIf you are using ES6 in your application source, but write your tests in ES5, you should know that Babel handles the interchangeable use of ES6 import and CommonJS require through its interop capability to run two module formats side-by-side, but the behavior is slightly different. If you add a second export beside your default export, you can no longer import the default using require('./App'). Instead you have to use require('./App').default.\n\nMiddleware\nMiddleware functions wrap behavior of dispatch calls in Redux, so to test this modified behavior we need to mock the behavior of the dispatch call.\nExample\nFirst, we'll need a middleware function. This is similar to the real redux-thunk.\nconst thunk = ({ dispatch, getState }) => next => action => {\n  if (typeof action === 'function') {\n    return action(dispatch, getState)\n  }\n\n  return next(action)\n}\n\nWe need to create a fake getState, dispatch, and next functions. We use jest.fn() to create stubs, but with other test frameworks you would likely use sinon.\nThe invoke function runs our middleware in the same way Redux does.\nconst create = () => {\n  const store = {\n    getState: jest.fn(() => ({})),\n    dispatch: jest.fn(),\n  };\n  const next = jest.fn()\n\n  const invoke = (action) => thunk(store)(next)(action)\n\n  return {store, next, invoke}\n};\n\nWe test that our middleware is calling the getState, dispatch, and next functions at the right time.\nit('passes through non-function action', () => {\n  const { next, invoke } = create()\n  const action = {type: 'TEST'}\n  invoke(action)\n  expect(next).toHaveBeenCalledWith(action)\n})\n\nit('calls the function', () => {\n  const { invoke } = create()\n  const fn = jest.fn()\n  invoke(fn)\n  expect(fn).toHaveBeenCalled()\n});\n\nit('passes dispatch and getState', () => {\n  const { store, invoke } = create()\n  invoke((dispatch, getState) => {\n    dispatch('TEST DISPATCH')\n    getState();\n  })\n  expect(store.dispatch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('TEST DISPATCH')\n  expect(store.getState).toHaveBeenCalled()\n});\n\nIn some cases, you will need to modify the create function to use different mock implementations of getState and next.\nGlossary\n\nEnzyme: Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.\n\nReact Test Utils: Test Utilities for React. Used by Enzyme.\n\nShallow rendering: Shallow rendering lets you instantiate a component and effectively get the result of its render method just a single level deep instead of rendering components recursively to a DOM. Shallow rendering is useful for unit tests, where you test a particular component only, and importantly not its children. This also means that changing a child component won't affect the tests for the parent component. Testing a component and all its children can be accomplished with Enzyme's mount() method, aka full DOM rendering.\n\n\n"},"docs/recipes/ComputingDerivedData.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/ComputingDerivedData.html","title":"Computing Derived Data","keywords":"","body":"Computing Derived Data\nReselect is a simple library for creating memoized, composable selector functions. Reselect selectors can be used to efficiently compute derived data from the Redux store.\nMotivation for Memoized Selectors\nLet's revisit the Todos List example:\ncontainers/VisibleTodoList.js\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '../actions'\nimport TodoList from '../components/TodoList'\n\nconst getVisibleTodos = (todos, filter) => {\n  switch (filter) {\n    case 'SHOW_ALL':\n      return todos\n    case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n      return todos.filter(t => t.completed)\n    case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n      return todos.filter(t => !t.completed)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapStateToProps = state => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: id => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\n\nIn the above example, mapStateToProps calls getVisibleTodos to calculate todos. This works great, but there is a drawback: todos is calculated every time the component is updated. If the state tree is large, or the calculation expensive, repeating the calculation on every update may cause performance problems. Reselect can help to avoid these unnecessary recalculations.\nCreating a Memoized Selector\nWe would like to replace getVisibleTodos with a memoized selector that recalculates todos when the value of state.todos or state.visibilityFilter changes, but not when changes occur in other (unrelated) parts of the state tree.\nReselect provides a function createSelector for creating memoized selectors. createSelector takes an array of input-selectors and a transform function as its arguments. If the Redux state tree is changed in a way that causes the value of an input-selector to change, the selector will call its transform function with the values of the input-selectors as arguments and return the result. If the values of the input-selectors are the same as the previous call to the selector, it will return the previously computed value instead of calling the transform function.\nLet's define a memoized selector named getVisibleTodos to replace the non-memoized version above:\nselectors/index.js\nimport { createSelector } from 'reselect'\n\nconst getVisibilityFilter = state => state.visibilityFilter\nconst getTodos = state => state.todos\n\nexport const getVisibleTodos = createSelector(\n  [getVisibilityFilter, getTodos],\n  (visibilityFilter, todos) => {\n    switch (visibilityFilter) {\n      case 'SHOW_ALL':\n        return todos\n      case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n        return todos.filter(t => t.completed)\n      case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n        return todos.filter(t => !t.completed)\n    }\n  }\n)\n\nIn the example above, getVisibilityFilter and getTodos are input-selectors. They are created as ordinary non-memoized selector functions because they do not transform the data they select. getVisibleTodos on the other hand is a memoized selector. It takes getVisibilityFilter and getTodos as input-selectors, and a transform function that calculates the filtered todos list.\nComposing Selectors\nA memoized selector can itself be an input-selector to another memoized selector. Here is getVisibleTodos being used as an input-selector to a selector that further filters the todos by keyword:\nconst getKeyword = state => state.keyword\n\nconst getVisibleTodosFilteredByKeyword = createSelector(\n  [getVisibleTodos, getKeyword],\n  (visibleTodos, keyword) =>\n    visibleTodos.filter(todo => todo.text.indexOf(keyword) > -1)\n)\n\nConnecting a Selector to the Redux Store\nIf you are using React Redux, you can call selectors as regular functions inside mapStateToProps():\ncontainers/VisibleTodoList.js\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '../actions'\nimport TodoList from '../components/TodoList'\nimport { getVisibleTodos } from '../selectors'\n\nconst mapStateToProps = state => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: id => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\n\nAccessing React Props in Selectors\n\nThis section introduces a hypothetical extension to our app that allows it to support multiple Todo Lists. Please note that a full implementation of this extension requires changes to the reducers, components, actions etc. that aren't directly relevant to the topics discussed and have been omitted for brevity.\n\nSo far we have only seen selectors receive the Redux store state as an argument, but a selector can receive props too.\nHere is an App component that renders three VisibleTodoList components, each of which has a listId prop:\ncomponents/App.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Footer from './Footer'\nimport AddTodo from '../containers/AddTodo'\nimport VisibleTodoList from '../containers/VisibleTodoList'\n\nconst App = () => (\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n)\n\nEach VisibleTodoList container should select a different slice of the state depending on the value of the listId prop, so let's modify getVisibilityFilter and getTodos to accept a props argument:\nselectors/todoSelectors.js\nimport { createSelector } from 'reselect'\n\nconst getVisibilityFilter = (state, props) =>\n  state.todoLists[props.listId].visibilityFilter\n\nconst getTodos = (state, props) => state.todoLists[props.listId].todos\n\nconst getVisibleTodos = createSelector(\n  [getVisibilityFilter, getTodos],\n  (visibilityFilter, todos) => {\n    switch (visibilityFilter) {\n      case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n        return todos.filter(todo => todo.completed)\n      case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n        return todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed)\n      default:\n        return todos\n    }\n  }\n)\n\nexport default getVisibleTodos\n\nprops can be passed to getVisibleTodos from mapStateToProps:\nconst mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state, props)\n  }\n}\n\nSo now getVisibleTodos has access to props, and everything seems to be working fine.\nBut there is a problem!\nUsing the getVisibleTodos selector with multiple instances of the visibleTodoList container will not correctly memoize:\ncontainers/VisibleTodoList.js\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '../actions'\nimport TodoList from '../components/TodoList'\nimport { getVisibleTodos } from '../selectors'\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {\n  return {\n    // WARNING: THE FOLLOWING SELECTOR DOES NOT CORRECTLY MEMOIZE\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state, props)\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: id => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\n\nA selector created with createSelector only returns the cached value when its set of arguments is the same as its previous set of arguments. If we alternate between rendering  and , the shared selector will alternate between receiving {listId: 1} and {listId: 2} as its props argument. This will cause the arguments to be different on each call, so the selector will always recompute instead of returning the cached value. We'll see how to overcome this limitation in the next section.\nSharing Selectors Across Multiple Components\n\nThe examples in this section require React Redux v4.3.0 or greater\n\nIn order to share a selector across multiple VisibleTodoList components and retain memoization, each instance of the component needs its own private copy of the selector.\nLet's create a function named makeGetVisibleTodos that returns a new copy of the getVisibleTodos selector each time it is called:\nselectors/todoSelectors.js\nimport { createSelector } from 'reselect'\n\nconst getVisibilityFilter = (state, props) =>\n  state.todoLists[props.listId].visibilityFilter\n\nconst getTodos = (state, props) => state.todoLists[props.listId].todos\n\nconst makeGetVisibleTodos = () => {\n  return createSelector(\n    [getVisibilityFilter, getTodos],\n    (visibilityFilter, todos) => {\n      switch (visibilityFilter) {\n        case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n          return todos.filter(todo => todo.completed)\n        case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n          return todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed)\n        default:\n          return todos\n      }\n    }\n  )\n}\n\nexport default makeGetVisibleTodos\n\nWe also need a way to give each instance of a container access to its own private selector. The mapStateToProps argument of connect can help with this.\nIf the mapStateToProps argument supplied to connect returns a function instead of an object, it will be used to create an individual mapStateToProps function for each instance of the container.\nIn the example below makeMapStateToProps creates a new getVisibleTodos selector, and returns a mapStateToProps function that has exclusive access to the new selector:\nconst makeMapStateToProps = () => {\n  const getVisibleTodos = makeGetVisibleTodos()\n  const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {\n    return {\n      todos: getVisibleTodos(state, props)\n    }\n  }\n  return mapStateToProps\n}\n\nIf we pass makeMapStateToProps to connect, each instance of the VisibleTodosList container will get its own mapStateToProps function with a private getVisibleTodos selector. Memoization will now work correctly regardless of the render order of the VisibleTodoList containers.\ncontainers/VisibleTodoList.js\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { toggleTodo } from '../actions'\nimport TodoList from '../components/TodoList'\nimport { makeGetVisibleTodos } from '../selectors'\n\nconst makeMapStateToProps = () => {\n  const getVisibleTodos = makeGetVisibleTodos()\n  const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {\n    return {\n      todos: getVisibleTodos(state, props)\n    }\n  }\n  return mapStateToProps\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {\n  return {\n    onTodoClick: id => {\n      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  makeMapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\n\nNext Steps\nCheck out the official documentation of Reselect as well as its FAQ. Most Redux projects start using Reselect when they have performance problems because of too many derived computations and wasted re-renders, so make sure you are familiar with it before you build something big. It can also be useful to study its source code so you don't think it's magic.\n"},"docs/recipes/ImplementingUndoHistory.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/ImplementingUndoHistory.html","title":"Implementing Undo History","keywords":"","body":"Implementing Undo History\nBuilding an Undo and Redo functionality into an app has traditionally required conscious effort from the developer. It is not an easy problem with classical MVC frameworks because you need to keep track of every past state by cloning all relevant models. In addition, you need to be mindful of the undo stack because the user-initiated changes should be undoable.\nThis means that implementing Undo and Redo in an MVC application usually forces you to rewrite parts of your application to use a specific data mutation pattern like Command.\nWith Redux, however, implementing undo history is a breeze. There are three reasons for this:\n\nThere are no multiple models—just a state subtree that you want to keep track of.\nThe state is already immutable, and mutations are already described as discrete actions, which is close to the undo stack mental model.\nThe reducer (state, action) => state signature makes it natural to implement generic “reducer enhancers” or “higher order reducers”. They are functions that take your reducer and enhance it with some additional functionality while preserving its signature. Undo history is exactly such a case.\n\nBefore proceeding, make sure you have worked through the basics tutorial and understand reducer composition well. This recipe will build on top of the example described in the basics tutorial.\nIn the first part of this recipe, we will explain the underlying concepts that make Undo and Redo possible to implement in a generic way.\nIn the second part of this recipe, we will show how to use Redux Undo package that provides this functionality out of the box.\n\nUnderstanding Undo History\nDesigning the State Shape\nUndo history is also part of your app's state, and there is no reason why we should approach it differently. Regardless of the type of the state changing over time, when you implement Undo and Redo, you want to keep track of the history of this state at different points in time.\nFor example, the state shape of a counter app might look like this:\n{\n  counter: 10\n}\n\nIf we wanted to implement Undo and Redo in such an app, we'd need to store more state so we can answer the following questions:\n\nIs there anything left to undo or redo?\nWhat is the current state?\nWhat are the past (and future) states in the undo stack?\n\nIt is reasonable to suggest that our state shape should change to answer these questions:\n{\n  counter: {\n    past: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n    present: 10,\n    future: []\n  }\n}\n\nNow, if user presses “Undo”, we want it to change to move into the past:\n{\n  counter: {\n    past: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],\n    present: 9,\n    future: [10]\n  }\n}\n\nAnd further yet:\n{\n  counter: {\n    past: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    present: 8,\n    future: [9, 10]\n  }\n}\n\nWhen the user presses “Redo”, we want to move one step back into the future:\n{\n  counter: {\n    past: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],\n    present: 9,\n    future: [10]\n  }\n}\n\nFinally, if the user performs an action (e.g. decrement the counter) while we're in the middle of the undo stack, we're going to discard the existing future:\n{\n  counter: {\n    past: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n    present: 8,\n    future: []\n  }\n}\n\nThe interesting part here is that it does not matter whether we want to keep an undo stack of numbers, strings, arrays, or objects. The structure will always be the same:\n{\n  counter: {\n    past: [0, 1, 2],\n    present: 3,\n    future: [4]\n  }\n}\n\n{\n  todos: {\n    past: [\n      [],\n      [{ text: 'Use Redux' }],\n      [{ text: 'Use Redux', complete: true }]\n    ],\n    present: [\n      { text: 'Use Redux', complete: true },\n      { text: 'Implement Undo' }\n    ],\n    future: [\n      [\n        { text: 'Use Redux', complete: true },\n        { text: 'Implement Undo', complete: true }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nIn general, it looks like this:\n{\n  past: Array,\n  present: T,\n  future: Array\n}\n\nIt is also up to us whether to keep a single top-level history:\n{\n  past: [\n    { counterA: 1, counterB: 1 },\n    { counterA: 1, counterB: 0 },\n    { counterA: 0, counterB: 0 }\n  ],\n  present: { counterA: 2, counterB: 1 },\n  future: []\n}\n\nOr many granular histories so user can undo and redo actions in them independently:\n{\n  counterA: {\n    past: [1, 0],\n    present: 2,\n    future: []\n  },\n  counterB: {\n    past: [0],\n    present: 1,\n    future: []\n  }\n}\n\nWe will see later how the approach we take lets us choose how granular Undo and Redo need to be.\nDesigning the Algorithm\nRegardless of the specific data type, the shape of the undo history state is the same:\n{\n  past: Array,\n  present: T,\n  future: Array\n}\n\nLet's talk through the algorithm to manipulate the state shape described above. We can define two actions to operate on this state: UNDO and REDO. In our reducer, we will do the following steps to handle these actions:\nHandling Undo\n\nRemove the last element from the past.\nSet the present to the element we removed in the previous step.\nInsert the old present state at the beginning of the future.\n\nHandling Redo\n\nRemove the first element from the future.\nSet the present to the element we removed in the previous step.\nInsert the old present state at the end of the past.\n\nHandling Other Actions\n\nInsert the present at the end of the past.\nSet the present to the new state after handling the action.\nClear the future.\n\nFirst Attempt: Writing a Reducer\nconst initialState = {\n  past: [],\n  present: null, // (?) How do we initialize the present?\n  future: []\n}\n\nfunction undoable(state = initialState, action) {\n  const { past, present, future } = state\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'UNDO':\n      const previous = past[past.length - 1]\n      const newPast = past.slice(0, past.length - 1)\n      return {\n        past: newPast,\n        present: previous,\n        future: [present, ...future]\n      }\n    case 'REDO':\n      const next = future[0]\n      const newFuture = future.slice(1)\n      return {\n        past: [...past, present],\n        present: next,\n        future: newFuture\n      }\n    default:\n      // (?) How do we handle other actions?\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nThis implementation isn't usable because it leaves out three important questions:\n\nWhere do we get the initial present state from? We don't seem to know it beforehand.\nWhere do we react to the external actions to save the present to the past?\nHow do we actually delegate the control over the present state to a custom reducer?\n\nIt seems that reducer isn't the right abstraction, but we're very close.\nMeet Reducer Enhancers\nYou might be familiar with higher order functions. If you use React, you might be familiar with higher order components. Here is a variation on the same pattern, applied to reducers.\nA reducer enhancer (or a higher order reducer) is a function that takes a reducer, and returns a new reducer that is able to handle new actions, or to hold more state, delegating control to the inner reducer for the actions it doesn't understand. This isn't a new pattern—technically, combineReducers() is also a reducer enhancer because it takes reducers and returns a new reducer.\nA reducer enhancer that doesn't do anything looks like this:\nfunction doNothingWith(reducer) {\n  return function (state, action) {\n    // Just call the passed reducer\n    return reducer(state, action)\n  }\n}\n\nA reducer enhancer that combines other reducers might look like this:\nfunction combineReducers(reducers) {\n  return function (state = {}, action) {\n    return Object.keys(reducers).reduce((nextState, key) => {\n      // Call every reducer with the part of the state it manages\n      nextState[key] = reducers[key](state[key], action)\n      return nextState\n    }, {})\n  }\n}\n\nSecond Attempt: Writing a Reducer Enhancer\nNow that we have a better understanding of reducer enhancers, we can see that this is exactly what undoable should have been:\nfunction undoable(reducer) {\n  // Call the reducer with empty action to populate the initial state\n  const initialState = {\n    past: [],\n    present: reducer(undefined, {}),\n    future: []\n  }\n\n  // Return a reducer that handles undo and redo\n  return function (state = initialState, action) {\n    const { past, present, future } = state\n\n    switch (action.type) {\n      case 'UNDO':\n        const previous = past[past.length - 1]\n        const newPast = past.slice(0, past.length - 1)\n        return {\n          past: newPast,\n          present: previous,\n          future: [present, ...future]\n        }\n      case 'REDO':\n        const next = future[0]\n        const newFuture = future.slice(1)\n        return {\n          past: [...past, present],\n          present: next,\n          future: newFuture\n        }\n      default:\n        // Delegate handling the action to the passed reducer\n        const newPresent = reducer(present, action)\n        if (present === newPresent) {\n          return state\n        }\n        return {\n          past: [...past, present],\n          present: newPresent,\n          future: []\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWe can now wrap any reducer into undoable reducer enhancer to teach it to react to UNDO and REDO actions.\n// This is a reducer\nfunction todos(state = [], action) {\n  /* ... */\n}\n\n// This is also a reducer!\nconst undoableTodos = undoable(todos)\n\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nconst store = createStore(undoableTodos)\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  text: 'Use Redux'\n})\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  text: 'Implement Undo'\n})\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'UNDO'\n})\n\nThere is an important gotcha: you need to remember to append .present to the current state when you retrieve it. You may also check .past.length and .future.length to determine whether to enable or to disable the Undo and Redo buttons, respectively.\nYou might have heard that Redux was influenced by Elm Architecture. It shouldn't come as a surprise that this example is very similar to elm-undo-redo package.\nUsing Redux Undo\nThis was all very informative, but can't we just drop a library and use it instead of implementing undoable ourselves? Sure, we can! Meet Redux Undo, a library that provides simple Undo and Redo functionality for any part of your Redux tree.\nIn this part of the recipe, you will learn how to make the Todo List example undoable. You can find the full source of this recipe in the todos-with-undo example that comes with Redux.\nInstallation\nFirst of all, you need to run\nnpm install --save redux-undo\nThis installs the package that provides the undoable reducer enhancer.\nWrapping the Reducer\nYou will need to wrap the reducer you wish to enhance with undoable function. For example, if you exported a todos reducer from a dedicated file, you will want to change it to export the result of calling undoable() with the reducer you wrote:\nreducers/todos.js\nimport undoable, { distinctState } from 'redux-undo'\n\n/* ... */\n\nconst todos = (state = [], action) => {\n  /* ... */\n}\n\nconst undoableTodos = undoable(todos, {\n  filter: distinctState()\n})\n\nexport default undoableTodos\n\nThe distinctState() filter serves to ignore the actions that didn't result in a state change. There are many other options to configure your undoable reducer, like setting the action type for Undo and Redo actions.\nNote that your combineReducers() call will stay exactly as it was, but the todos reducer will now refer to the reducer enhanced with Redux Undo:\nreducers/index.js\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux'\nimport todos from './todos'\nimport visibilityFilter from './visibilityFilter'\n\nconst todoApp = combineReducers({\n  todos,\n  visibilityFilter\n})\n\nexport default todoApp\n\nYou may wrap one or more reducers in undoable at any level of the reducer composition hierarchy. We choose to wrap todos instead of the top-level combined reducer so that changes to visibilityFilter are not reflected in the undo history.\nUpdating the Selectors\nNow the todos part of the state looks like this:\n{\n  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',\n  todos: {\n    past: [\n      [],\n      [{ text: 'Use Redux' }],\n      [{ text: 'Use Redux', complete: true }]\n    ],\n    present: [\n      { text: 'Use Redux', complete: true },\n      { text: 'Implement Undo' }\n    ],\n    future: [\n      [\n        { text: 'Use Redux', complete: true },\n        { text: 'Implement Undo', complete: true }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nThis means you need to access your state with state.todos.present instead of\njust state.todos:\ncontainers/VisibleTodoList.js\nconst mapStateToProps = state => {\n  return {\n    todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos.present, state.visibilityFilter)\n  }\n}\n\nAdding the Buttons\nNow all you need to do is add the buttons for the Undo and Redo actions.\nFirst, create a new container component called UndoRedo for these buttons. We won't bother to split the presentational part into a separate file because it is very small:\ncontainers/UndoRedo.js\nimport React from 'react'\n\n/* ... */\n\nlet UndoRedo = ({ canUndo, canRedo, onUndo, onRedo }) => (\n  \n    \n      Undo\n    \n    \n      Redo\n    \n  \n)\n\nYou will use connect() from React Redux to generate a container component. To determine whether to enable Undo and Redo buttons, you can check state.todos.past.length and state.todos.future.length. You won't need to write action creators for performing undo and redo because Redux Undo already provides them:\ncontainers/UndoRedo.js\n/* ... */\n\nimport { ActionCreators as UndoActionCreators } from 'redux-undo'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\n/* ... */\n\nconst mapStateToProps = state => {\n  return {\n    canUndo: state.todos.past.length > 0,\n    canRedo: state.todos.future.length > 0\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {\n  return {\n    onUndo: () => dispatch(UndoActionCreators.undo()),\n    onRedo: () => dispatch(UndoActionCreators.redo())\n  }\n}\n\nUndoRedo = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(UndoRedo)\n\nexport default UndoRedo\n\nNow you can add UndoRedo component to the App component:\ncomponents/App.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Footer from './Footer'\nimport AddTodo from '../containers/AddTodo'\nimport VisibleTodoList from '../containers/VisibleTodoList'\nimport UndoRedo from '../containers/UndoRedo'\n\nconst App = () => (\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n)\n\nexport default App\n\nThis is it! Run npm install and npm start in the example folder and try it out!\n"},"docs/recipes/IsolatingSubapps.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/IsolatingSubapps.html","title":"Isolating Subapps","keywords":"","body":"Isolating Redux Sub-Apps\nConsider the case of a “big” app (contained in a  component)\nthat embeds smaller “sub-apps” (contained in  components):\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport SubApp from './subapp'\n\nclass BigApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n        \n        \n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nThese s will be completely independent.

The Redux store calls that write logic function and passes in the current state tree and the descriptive object, the write logic function returns some new state tree, and the Redux store notifies any subscribers that the state tree has changed.  \nRedux puts some basic constraints on how that write logic function should work.  As described in Reducers, it has to have a signature of (previousState, action) => newState, is known as a reducer function, and must be pure and predictable.\nBeyond that, Redux does not really care how you actually structure your logic inside that reducer function, as long as it obeys those basic rules.  This is both a source of freedom and a source of confusion.  However, there are a number of common patterns that are widely used when writing reducers, as well as a number of related topics and concepts to be aware of.  As an application grows, these patterns play a crucial role in managing reducer code complexity, handling real-world data, and optimizing UI performance.  \nPrerequisite Concepts for Writing Reducers\nSome of these concepts are already described elsewhere in the Redux documentation.  Others are generic and applicable outside of Redux itself, and there are numerous existing articles that cover these concepts in detail.  These concepts and techniques form the foundation of writing solid Redux reducer logic.\nIt is vital that these Prerequisite Concepts are thoroughly understood before moving on to more advanced and Redux-specific techniques. A recommended reading list is available at:\nPrerequisite Concepts\nIt's also important to note that some of these suggestions may or may not be directly applicable based on architectural decisions in a specific application.  For example, an application using Immutable.js Maps to store data would likely have its reducer logic structured at least somewhat differently than an application using plain Javascript objects.  This documentation primarily assumes use of plain Javascript objects, but many of the principles would still apply if using other tools.\nReducer Concepts and Techniques\n\nBasic Reducer Structure\nSplitting Reducer Logic\nRefactoring Reducers Example\nUsing combineReducers\nBeyond combineReducers\nNormalizing State Shape\nUpdating Normalized Data\nReusing Reducer Logic\nImmutable Update Patterns\nInitializing State\n\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/PrerequisiteConcepts.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/PrerequisiteConcepts.html","title":"Prerequisite Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Prerequisite Reducer Concepts\nAs described in Reducers, a Redux reducer function:\n\nShould have a signature of (previousState, action) => newState, similar to the type of function you would pass to Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue)\nShould be \"pure\", which means the reducer:\nDoes not perform side effects (such as calling API's or modifying non-local objects or variables).\nDoes not call non-pure functions (like Date.now or Math.random).\nDoes not mutate its arguments. If the reducer updates state, it should not modify the existing state object in-place.  Instead, it should generate a new object containing the necessary changes. The same approach should be used for any sub-objects within state that the reducer updates.\n\n\n\n\nNote on immutability, side effects, and mutation\nMutation is discouraged because it generally breaks time-travel debugging, and React Redux's connect function:\n\nFor time traveling, the Redux DevTools expect that replaying recorded actions would output a state value, but not change anything else. Side effects like mutation or asynchronous behavior will cause time travel to alter behavior between steps, breaking the application.\nFor React Redux, connect checks to see if the props returned from a mapStateToProps function have changed in order to determine if a component needs to update.  To improve performance, connect takes some shortcuts that rely on the state being immutable, and uses shallow reference equality checks to detect changes. This means that changes made to objects and arrays by direct mutation will not be detected, and components will not re-render.\n\nOther side effects like generating unique IDs or timestamps in a reducer also make the code unpredictable and harder to debug and test.\n\nBecause of these rules, it's important that the following core concepts are fully understood before moving on to other specific techniques for organizing Redux reducers:\nRedux Reducer Basics\nKey concepts:\n\nThinking in terms of state and state shape\nDelegating update responsibility by slice of state (reducer composition)\nHigher order reducers\nDefining reducer initial state\n\nReading list:\n\nRedux Docs: Reducers\nRedux Docs: Reducing Boilerplate\nRedux Docs: Implementing Undo History\nRedux Docs: combineReducers\nThe Power of Higher-Order Reducers\nStack Overflow: Store initial state and combineReducers\nStack Overflow: State key names and combineReducers\n\nPure Functions and Side Effects\nKey Concepts:\n\nSide effects\nPure functions\nHow to think in terms of combining functions\n\nReading List:\n\nThe Little Idea of Functional Programming\nUnderstanding Programmatic Side-Effects\nLearning Functional Programming in Javascript\nAn Introduction to Reasonably Pure Functional Programming\n\nImmutable Data Management\nKey Concepts:\n\nMutability vs immutability\nImmutably updating objects and arrays safely\nAvoiding functions and statements that mutate state\n\nReading List:\n\nPros and Cons of Using Immutability With React\nJavascript and Immutability\nImmutable Data using ES6 and Beyond\nImmutable Data from Scratch\nRedux Docs: Using the Object Spread Operator\n\nNormalizing Data\nKey Concepts:\n\nDatabase structure and organization\nSplitting relational/nested data up into separate tables\nStoring a single definition for a given item\nReferring to items by IDs\nUsing objects keyed by item IDs as lookup tables, and arrays of IDs to track ordering\nAssociating items in relationships\n\nReading List:\n\nDatabase Normalization in Simple English\nIdiomatic Redux: Normalizing the State Shape\nNormalizr Documentation\nRedux Without Profanity: Normalizr\nQuerying a Redux Store\nWikipedia: Associative Entity\nDatabase Design: Many-to-Many\nAvoiding Accidental Complexity When Structuring Your App State\n\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/BasicReducerStructure.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/BasicReducerStructure.html","title":"Basic Reducer Structure","keywords":"","body":"Basic Reducer Structure and State Shape\nBasic Reducer Structure\nFirst and foremost, it's important to understand that your entire application really only has one single reducer function: the function that you've passed into createStore as the first argument.  That one single reducer function ultimately needs to do several things:\n\nThe first time the reducer is called, the state value will be undefined.  The reducer needs to handle this case by supplying a default state value before handling the incoming action.\nIt needs to look at the previous state and the dispatched action, and determine what kind of work needs to be done\nAssuming actual changes need to occur, it needs to create new objects and arrays with the updated data and return those\nIf no changes are needed, it should return the existing state as-is. \n\nThe simplest possible approach to writing reducer logic is to put everything into a single function declaration, like this:\nfunction counter(state, action) {\n  if (typeof state === 'undefined') {\n    state = 0; // If state is undefined, initialize it with a default value\n  }\n\n  if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {\n    return state + 1;\n  } \n  else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {\n    return state - 1;\n  } \n  else {\n    return state; // In case an action is passed in we don't understand\n  }\n}\n\nNotice that this simple function fulfills all the basic requirements.  It returns a default value if none exists, initializing the store; it determines what sort of update needs to be done based on the type of the action, and returns new values; and it returns the previous state if no work needs to be done.  \nThere are some simple tweaks that can be made to this reducer.  First, repeated if/else statements quickly grow tiresome, so it's very common to use switch statements instead.  Second, we can use ES6's default parameter values to handle the initial \"no existing data\" case.  With those changes, the reducer would look like:\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return state + 1;\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return state - 1;\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n\nThis is the basic structure that a typical Redux reducer function uses.\nBasic State Shape\nRedux encourages you to think about your application in terms of the data you need to manage.  The data at any given point in time is the \"state\" of your application, and the structure and organization of that state is typically referred to as its \"shape\".  The shape of your state plays a major role in how you structure your reducer logic.\nA Redux state usually has a plain Javascript object as the top of the state tree. (It is certainly possible to have another type of data instead, such as a single number, an array, or a specialized data structure, but most libraries assume that the top-level value is a plain object.)  The most common way to organize data within that top-level object is to further divide data into sub-trees, where each top-level key represents some \"domain\" or \"slice\" of related data.  For example, a basic Todo app's state might look like: \n{\n  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',\n  todos: [\n    {\n      text: 'Consider using Redux',\n      completed: true,\n    },\n    {\n      text: 'Keep all state in a single tree',\n      completed: false\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nIn this example, todos and visibilityFilter are both top-level keys in the state, and each represents a \"slice\" of data for some particular concept.\nMost applications deal with multiple types of data, which can be broadly divided into three categories:\n\nDomain data: data that the application needs to show, use, or modify (such as \"all of the Todos retrieved from the server\")\nApp state: data that is specific to the application's behavior (such as \"Todo #5 is currently selected\", or \"there is a request in progress to fetch Todos\")\nUI state: data that represents how the UI is currently displayed (such as \"The EditTodo modal dialog is currently open\")\n\nBecause the store represents the core of your application, you should define your state shape in terms of your domain data and app state, not your UI component tree.  As an example, a shape of state.leftPane.todoList.todos would be a bad idea, because the idea of \"todos\" is central to the whole application, not just a single part of the UI.  The todos slice should be at the top of the state tree instead.\nThere will rarely be a 1-to-1 correspondence between your UI tree and your state shape.  The exception to that might be if you are explicitly tracking various aspects of UI data in your Redux store as well, but even then the shape of the UI data and the shape of the domain data would likely be different.\nA typical app's state shape might look roughly like:\n{\n    domainData1 : {},\n    domainData2 : {},\n    appState1 : {},\n    appState2 : {},\n    ui : {\n        uiState1 : {},\n        uiState2 : {},\n    }\n}\n\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/SplittingReducerLogic.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/SplittingReducerLogic.html","title":"Splitting Reducer Logic","keywords":"","body":"Splitting Up Reducer Logic\nFor any meaningful application, putting all your update logic into a single reducer function is quickly going to become unmaintainable.  While there's no single rule for how long a function should be, it's generally agreed that functions should be relatively short and ideally only do one specific thing.  Because of this, it's good programming practice to take pieces of code that are very long or do many different things, and break them into smaller pieces that are easier to understand.\nSince a Redux reducer is just a function, the same concept applies.  You can split some of your reducer logic out into another function, and call that new function from the parent function.  \nThese new functions would typically fall into one of three categories:\n\nSmall utility functions containing some reusable chunk of logic that is needed in multiple places (which may or may not be actually related to the specific business logic)\nFunctions for handling a specific update case, which often need parameters other than the typical (state, action) pair\nFunctions which handle all updates for a given slice of state.  These functions do generally have the typical (state, action) parameter signature\n\nFor clarity, these terms will be used to distinguish between different types of functions and different use cases:\n\nreducer: any function with the signature (state, action) -> newState (ie, any function that could be used as an argument to Array.prototype.reduce)\nroot reducer: the reducer function that is actually passed as the first argument to createStore.  This is the only part of the reducer logic that must have the (state, action) -> newState signature.\nslice reducer: a reducer that is being used to handle updates to one specific slice of the state tree, usually done by passing it to combineReducers\ncase function: a function that is being used to handle the update logic for a specific action.  This may actually be a reducer function, or it may require other parameters to do its work properly.\nhigher-order reducer: a function that takes a reducer function as an argument, and/or returns a new reducer function as a result (such as combineReducers, or redux-undo)\n\nThe term \"sub-reducer\" has also been used in various discussions to mean any function that is not the root reducer, although the term is not very precise.  Some people may also refer to some functions as \"business logic\" (functions that relate to application-specific behavior) or \"utility functions\" (generic functions that are not application-specific).\nBreaking down a complex process into smaller, more understandable parts is usually described with the term functional decomposition.  This term and concept can be applied generically to any code.  However, in Redux it is very common to structure reducer logic using approach #3, where update logic is delegated to other functions based on slice of state.  Redux refers to this concept as reducer composition, and it is by far the most widely-used approach to structuring reducer logic.  In fact, it's so common that Redux includes a utility function called combineReducers(), which specifically abstracts the process of delegating work to other reducer functions based on slices of state. However, it's important to note that it is not the only pattern that can be used.  In fact, it's entirely possible to use all three approaches for splitting up logic into functions, and usually a good idea as well.  The Refactoring Reducers section shows some examples of this in action.\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/RefactoringReducersExample.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/RefactoringReducersExample.html","title":"Refactoring Reducers Example","keywords":"","body":"Refactoring Reducer Logic Using Functional Decomposition and Reducer Composition\nIt may be helpful to see examples of what the different types of sub-reducer functions look like and how they fit together.  Let's look at a demonstration of how a large single reducer function can be refactored into a composition of several smaller functions.\n\nNote: this example is deliberately written in a verbose style in order to illustrate the concepts and the process of refactoring, rather than perfectly concise code.\n\nInitial Reducer\nLet's say that our initial reducer looks like this:\nconst initialState = {\n    visibilityFilter : 'SHOW_ALL',\n    todos : []\n};\n\n\nfunction appReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' : { \n            return Object.assign({}, state, {\n                visibilityFilter : action.filter\n            });\n        }\n        case 'ADD_TODO' : {\n            return Object.assign({}, state, {\n                todos : state.todos.concat({\n                    id: action.id,\n                    text: action.text,\n                    completed: false\n                })\n            });\n        }\n        case 'TOGGLE_TODO' : {\n            return Object.assign({}, state, {\n                todos : state.todos.map(todo => {\n                    if (todo.id !== action.id) {\n                      return todo;\n                    }\n\n                    return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n                        completed : !todo.completed\n                    })\n                  })\n            });\n        } \n        case 'EDIT_TODO' : {\n            return Object.assign({}, state, {\n                todos : state.todos.map(todo => {\n                    if (todo.id !== action.id) {\n                      return todo;\n                    }\n\n                    return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n                        text : action.text\n                    })\n                  })\n            });\n        } \n        default : return state;\n    }\n}\n\nThat function is fairly short, but already becoming overly complex.  We're dealing with two different areas of concern (filtering vs managing our list of todos), the nesting is making the update logic harder to read, and it's not exactly clear what's going on everywhere.\nExtracting Utility Functions\nA good first step might be to break out a utility function to return a new object with updated fields.  There's also a repeated pattern with trying to update a specific item in an array that we could extract to a function: \nfunction updateObject(oldObject, newValues) {\n    // Encapsulate the idea of passing a new object as the first parameter\n    // to Object.assign to ensure we correctly copy data instead of mutating\n    return Object.assign({}, oldObject, newValues);\n}\n\nfunction updateItemInArray(array, itemId, updateItemCallback) {\n    const updatedItems = array.map(item => {\n        if(item.id !== itemId) {\n            // Since we only want to update one item, preserve all others as they are now\n            return item;\n        }\n\n        // Use the provided callback to create an updated item\n        const updatedItem = updateItemCallback(item);\n        return updatedItem;\n    });\n\n    return updatedItems;\n}\n\nfunction appReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' : { \n            return updateObject(state, {visibilityFilter : action.filter});\n        }\n        case 'ADD_TODO' : {\n            const newTodos = state.todos.concat({\n                id: action.id,\n                text: action.text,\n                completed: false\n            });\n\n            return updateObject(state, {todos : newTodos});\n        }\n        case 'TOGGLE_TODO' : {\n            const newTodos = updateItemInArray(state.todos, action.id, todo => {\n                return updateObject(todo, {completed : !todo.completed});\n            });\n\n            return updateObject(state, {todos : newTodos});\n        } \n        case 'EDIT_TODO' : {\n            const newTodos = updateItemInArray(state.todos, action.id, todo => {\n                return updateObject(todo, {text : action.text});\n            });\n\n            return updateObject(state, {todos : newTodos});\n        } \n        default : return state;\n    }\n}\n\nThat reduced the duplication and made things a bit easier to read.\nExtracting Case Reducers\nNext, we can split each specific case into its own function:\n// Omitted\nfunction updateObject(oldObject, newValues) {}\nfunction updateItemInArray(array, itemId, updateItemCallback) {}\n\n\nfunction setVisibilityFilter(state, action) {\n    return updateObject(state, {visibilityFilter : action.filter });\n}\n\nfunction addTodo(state, action) {\n    const newTodos = state.todos.concat({\n        id: action.id,\n        text: action.text,\n        completed: false\n    });\n\n    return updateObject(state, {todos : newTodos});\n}\n\nfunction toggleTodo(state, action) {\n    const newTodos = updateItemInArray(state.todos, action.id, todo => {\n        return updateObject(todo, {completed : !todo.completed});\n    });\n\n    return updateObject(state, {todos : newTodos});\n}\n\nfunction editTodo(state, action) {\n    const newTodos = updateItemInArray(state.todos, action.id, todo => {\n        return updateObject(todo, {text : action.text});\n    });\n\n    return updateObject(state, {todos : newTodos});\n}\n\nfunction appReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' : return setVisibilityFilter(state, action);\n        case 'ADD_TODO' : return addTodo(state, action);\n        case 'TOGGLE_TODO' : return toggleTodo(state, action);\n        case 'EDIT_TODO' : return editTodo(state, action);\n        default : return state;\n    }\n}\n\nNow it's very clear what's happening in each case.  We can also start to see some patterns emerging.  \nSeparating Data Handling by Domain\nOur app reducer is still aware of all the different cases for our application.  Let's try splitting things up so that the filter logic and the todo logic are separated:\n// Omitted\nfunction updateObject(oldObject, newValues) {}\nfunction updateItemInArray(array, itemId, updateItemCallback) {}\n\n\n\nfunction setVisibilityFilter(visibilityState, action) {\n    // Technically, we don't even care about the previous state\n    return action.filter;\n}\n\nfunction visibilityReducer(visibilityState = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' : return setVisibilityFilter(visibilityState, action);\n        default : return visibilityState;\n    }\n};\n\n\nfunction addTodo(todosState, action) {\n    const newTodos = todosState.concat({\n        id: action.id,\n        text: action.text,\n        completed: false\n    });\n\n    return newTodos;\n}\n\nfunction toggleTodo(todosState, action) {\n    const newTodos = updateItemInArray(todosState, action.id, todo => {\n        return updateObject(todo, {completed : !todo.completed});\n    });\n\n    return newTodos;\n}\n\nfunction editTodo(todosState, action) {\n    const newTodos = updateItemInArray(todosState, action.id, todo => {\n        return updateObject(todo, {text : action.text});\n    });\n\n    return newTodos;\n}\n\nfunction todosReducer(todosState = [], action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case 'ADD_TODO' : return addTodo(todosState, action);\n        case 'TOGGLE_TODO' : return toggleTodo(todosState, action);\n        case 'EDIT_TODO' : return editTodo(todosState, action);\n        default : return todosState;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction appReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    return {\n        todos : todosReducer(state.todos, action),\n        visibilityFilter : visibilityReducer(state.visibilityFilter, action)\n    };\n}\n\nNotice that because the two \"slice of state\" reducers are now getting only their own part of the whole state as arguments, they no longer need to return complex nested state objects, and are now simpler as a result.\nReducing Boilerplate\nWe're almost done.  Since many people don't like switch statements, it's very common to use a function that creates a lookup table of action types to case functions.  We'll use the createReducer function described in Reducing Boilerplate:\n// Omitted\nfunction updateObject(oldObject, newValues) {}\nfunction updateItemInArray(array, itemId, updateItemCallback) {}\n\nfunction createReducer(initialState, handlers) {\n  return function reducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    if (handlers.hasOwnProperty(action.type)) {\n      return handlers[action.type](state, action)\n    } else {\n      return state\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n// Omitted\nfunction setVisibilityFilter(visibilityState, action) {}\n\nconst visibilityReducer = createReducer('SHOW_ALL', {\n    'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' : setVisibilityFilter\n});\n\n// Omitted\nfunction addTodo(todosState, action) {}\nfunction toggleTodo(todosState, action) {}\nfunction editTodo(todosState, action) {}\n\nconst todosReducer = createReducer([], {\n    'ADD_TODO' : addTodo,\n    'TOGGLE_TODO' : toggleTodo,\n    'EDIT_TODO' : editTodo\n});\n\nfunction appReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    return {\n        todos : todosReducer(state.todos, action),\n        visibilityFilter : visibilityReducer(state.visibilityFilter, action)\n    };\n}\n\nCombining Reducers by Slice\nAs our last step, we can now use Redux's built-in combineReducers utility to handle the \"slice-of-state\" logic for our top-level app reducer.  Here's the final result:\n// Reusable utility functions\n\nfunction updateObject(oldObject, newValues) {\n    // Encapsulate the idea of passing a new object as the first parameter\n    // to Object.assign to ensure we correctly copy data instead of mutating\n    return Object.assign({}, oldObject, newValues);\n}\n\nfunction updateItemInArray(array, itemId, updateItemCallback) {\n    const updatedItems = array.map(item => {\n        if(item.id !== itemId) {\n            // Since we only want to update one item, preserve all others as they are now\n            return item;\n        }\n\n        // Use the provided callback to create an updated item\n        const updatedItem = updateItemCallback(item);\n        return updatedItem;\n    });\n\n    return updatedItems;\n}\n\nfunction createReducer(initialState, handlers) {\n  return function reducer(state = initialState, action) {\n    if (handlers.hasOwnProperty(action.type)) {\n      return handlers[action.type](state, action)\n    } else {\n      return state\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n// Handler for a specific case (\"case reducer\")\nfunction setVisibilityFilter(visibilityState, action) {\n    // Technically, we don't even care about the previous state\n    return action.filter;\n}\n\n// Handler for an entire slice of state (\"slice reducer\")\nconst visibilityReducer = createReducer('SHOW_ALL', {\n    'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' : setVisibilityFilter\n});\n\n// Case reducer\nfunction addTodo(todosState, action) {\n    const newTodos = todosState.concat({\n        id: action.id,\n        text: action.text,\n        completed: false\n    });\n\n    return newTodos;\n}\n\n// Case reducer\nfunction toggleTodo(todosState, action) {\n    const newTodos = updateItemInArray(todosState, action.id, todo => {\n        return updateObject(todo, {completed : !todo.completed});\n    });\n\n    return newTodos;\n}\n\n// Case reducer\nfunction editTodo(todosState, action) {\n    const newTodos = updateItemInArray(todosState, action.id, todo => {\n        return updateObject(todo, {text : action.text});\n    });\n\n    return newTodos;\n}\n\n// Slice reducer\nconst todosReducer = createReducer([], {\n    'ADD_TODO' : addTodo,\n    'TOGGLE_TODO' : toggleTodo,\n    'EDIT_TODO' : editTodo\n});\n\n// \"Root reducer\"\nconst appReducer = combineReducers({\n    visibilityFilter : visibilityReducer,\n    todos : todosReducer\n});\n\nWe now have examples of several kinds of split-up reducer functions:  helper utilities like updateObject and createReducer, handlers for specific cases like setVisibilityFilter and addTodo, and slice-of-state handlers like visibilityReducer and todosReducer.  We also can see that appReducer is an example of a \"root reducer\".\nAlthough the final result in this example is noticeably longer than the original version, this is primarily due to the extraction of the utility functions, the addition of comments, and some deliberate verbosity for the sake of clarity, such as separate return statements.  Looking at each function individually, the amount of responsibility is now smaller, and the intent is hopefully clearer.  Also, in a real application, these functions would probably then be split into separate files such as reducerUtilities.js, visibilityReducer.js, todosReducer.js, and rootReducer.js.\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/UsingCombineReducers.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/UsingCombineReducers.html","title":"Using combineReducers","keywords":"","body":"Using combineReducers\nCore Concepts\nThe most common state shape for a Redux app is a plain Javascript object containing \"slices\" of domain-specific data at each top-level key.  Similarly, the most common approach to writing reducer logic for that state shape is to have \"slice reducer\" functions, each with the same (state, action) signature, and each responsible for managing all updates to that specific slice of state.  Multiple slice reducers can respond to the same action, independently update their own slice as needed, and the updated slices are combined into the new state object.\nBecause this pattern is so common, Redux provides the combineReducers utility to implement that behavior.  It is an example of a higher-order reducer, which takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and returns a new reducer function.\nThere are several important ideas to be aware of when using combineReducers:\n\nFirst and foremost, combineReducers is simply a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux reducers.  You are not required to use it in your own application, and it does not handle every possible scenario.  It is entirely possible to write reducer logic without using it, and it is quite common to need to write custom reducer logic for cases that combineReducer does not handle.  (See Beyond combineReducers for examples and suggestions.)  \nWhile Redux itself is not opinionated about how your state is organized, combineReducers enforces several rules to help users avoid common errors.  (See combineReducers for details.)\nOne frequently asked question is whether Redux \"calls all reducers\" when dispatching an action.  Since there really is only one root reducer function, the default answer is \"no, it does not\".  However, combineReducers has specific behavior that does work that way.  In order to assemble the new state tree, combineReducers will call each slice reducer with its current slice of state and the current action, giving the slice reducer a chance to respond and update its slice of state if needed.  So, in that sense, using combineReducers does \"call all reducers\", or at least all of the slice reducers it is wrapping.\nYou can use it at all levels of your reducer structure, not just to create the root reducer.  It's very common to have multiple combined reducers in various places, which are composed together to create the root reducer.\n\nDefining State Shape\nThere are two ways to define the initial shape and contents of your store's state.  First, the createStore function can take preloadedState as its second argument.  This is primarily intended for initializing the store with state that was previously persisted elsewhere, such as the browser's localStorage.  The other way is for the root reducer to return the initial state value when the state argument is undefined.  These two approaches are described in more detail in Initializing State, but there are some additional concerns to be aware of when using combineReducers.\ncombineReducers takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and creates a function that outputs a corresponding state object with the same keys.  This means that if no preloaded state is provided to createStore, the naming of the keys in the input slice reducer object will define the naming of the keys in the output state object.  The correlation between these names is not always apparent, especially when using ES6 features such as default module exports and object literal shorthands.\nHere's an example of how use of ES6 object literal shorthand with combineReducers can define the state shape:\n// reducers.js\nexport default theDefaultReducer = (state = 0, action) => state;\n\nexport const firstNamedReducer = (state = 1, action) => state;\n\nexport const secondNamedReducer = (state = 2, action) => state;\n\n\n// rootReducer.js\nimport {combineReducers, createStore} from \"redux\";\n\nimport theDefaultReducer, {firstNamedReducer, secondNamedReducer} from \"./reducers\";\n\n// Use ES6 object literal shorthand syntax to define the object shape\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    theDefaultReducer,\n    firstNamedReducer,\n    secondNamedReducer\n});\n\nconst store = createStore(rootReducer);\nconsole.log(store.getState());\n// {theDefaultReducer : 0, firstNamedReducer : 1, secondNamedReducer : 2}\n\nNotice that because we used the ES6 shorthand for defining an object literal, the key names in the resulting state are the same as the variable names from the imports.  This may not always be the desired behavior, and is often a cause of confusion for those who aren't as familiar with ES6 syntax.\nAlso, the resulting names are a bit odd.  It's generally not a good practice to actually include words like \"reducer\" in your state key names - the keys should simply reflect the domain or type of data they hold.  This means we should either explicitly specify the names of the keys in the slice reducer object to define the keys in the output state object, or carefully rename the variables for the imported slice reducers to set up the keys when using the shorthand object literal syntax.\nA better usage might look like:\nimport {combineReducers, createStore} from \"redux\";\n\n// Rename the default import to whatever name we want. We can also rename a named import.\nimport defaultState, {firstNamedReducer, secondNamedReducer as secondState} from \"./reducers\";\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    defaultState,                   // key name same as the carefully renamed default export\n    firstState : firstNamedReducer, // specific key name instead of the variable name\n    secondState,                    // key name same as the carefully renamed named export\n});\n\nconst reducerInitializedStore = createStore(rootReducer);\nconsole.log(reducerInitializedStore.getState());\n// {defaultState : 0, firstState : 1, secondState : 2}\n\nThis state shape better reflects the data involved, because we took care to set up the keys we passed to combineReducers.\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/BeyondCombineReducers.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/BeyondCombineReducers.html","title":"Beyond combineReducers","keywords":"","body":"Beyond combineReducers\nThe combineReducers utility included with Redux is very useful, but is deliberately limited to handle a single common use case: updating a state tree that is a plain Javascript object, by delegating the work of updating each slice of state to a specific slice reducer.  It does not handle other use cases, such as a state tree made up of Immutable.js Maps, trying to pass other portions of the state tree as an additional argument to a slice reducer, or performing \"ordering\" of slice reducer calls.  It also does not care how a given slice reducer does its work.\nThe common question, then, is \"How can I use combineReducers to handle these other use cases?\".  The answer to that is simply: \"you don't - you probably need to use something else\".  Once you go past the core use case for combineReducers, it's time to use more \"custom\" reducer logic, whether it be specific logic for a one-off use case, or a reusable function that could be widely shared.  Here's some suggestions for dealing with a couple of these typical use cases, but feel free to come up with your own approaches.\nUsing slice reducers with Immutable.js objects\nSince combineReducers currently only works with plain Javascript objects, an application that uses an Immutable.js Map object for the top of its state tree could not use combineReducers to manage that Map.  Since many developers do use Immutable.js, there are a number of published utilities that provide equivalent functionality, such as redux-immutable.  This package provides its own implementation of combineReducers that knows how to iterate over an Immutable Map instead of a plain Javascript object.\nSharing data between slice reducers\nSimilarly, if sliceReducerA happens to need some data from sliceReducerB's slice of state in order to handle a particular action, or sliceReducerB happens to need the entire state as an argument, combineReducers does not handle that itself.  This could be resolved by writing a custom function that knows to pass the needed data as an additional argument in those specific cases, such as:\nfunction combinedReducer(state, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case \"A_TYPICAL_ACTION\" : {\n            return {\n                a : sliceReducerA(state.a, action),\n                b : sliceReducerB(state.b, action)\n            };\n        }\n        case \"SOME_SPECIAL_ACTION\" : {\n            return {\n                // specifically pass state.b as an additional argument\n                a : sliceReducerA(state.a, action, state.b),\n                b : sliceReducerB(state.b, action)\n            }        \n        }\n        case \"ANOTHER_SPECIAL_ACTION\" : {\n            return {\n                a : sliceReducerA(state.a, action),\n                // specifically pass the entire state as an additional argument\n                b : sliceReducerB(state.b, action, state)\n            }         \n        }    \n        default: return state;\n    }\n}\n\nAnother alternative to the \"shared-slice updates\" issue would be to simply put more data into the action.  This is easily accomplished using thunk functions or a similar approach, per this example:\nfunction someSpecialActionCreator() {\n    return (dispatch, getState) => {\n        const state = getState();\n        const dataFromB = selectImportantDataFromB(state);\n\n        dispatch({\n            type : \"SOME_SPECIAL_ACTION\",\n            payload : {\n                dataFromB\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nBecause the data from B's slice is already in the action, the parent reducer doesn't have to do anything special to make that data available to sliceReducerA.\nA third approach would be to use the reducer generated by combineReducers to handle the \"simple\" cases where each slice reducer can update itself independently, but also use another reducer to handle the \"special\" cases where data needs to be shared across slices.  Then, a wrapping function could call both of those reducers in turn to generate the final result:  \nconst combinedReducer = combineReducers({\n    a : sliceReducerA,\n    b : sliceReducerB\n}); \n\nfunction crossSliceReducer(state, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case \"SOME_SPECIAL_ACTION\" : {\n            return {\n                // specifically pass state.b as an additional argument\n                a : handleSpecialCaseForA(state.a, action, state.b),\n                b : sliceReducerB(state.b, action)\n            }        \n        }\n        default : return state;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction rootReducer(state, action) {\n    const intermediateState = combinedReducer(state, action);\n    const finalState = crossSliceReducer(intermediateState, action);\n    return finalState;\n}\n\nAs it turns out, there's a useful utility called reduce-reducers that can make that process easier.  It simply takes multiple reducers and runs reduce() on them, passing the intermediate state values to the next reducer in line:\n// Same as the \"manual\" rootReducer above\nconst rootReducer = reduceReducers(combinedReducers, crossSliceReducer);\n\nNote that if you use reduceReducers, you should make sure that the first reducer in the list is able to define the initial state, since the later reducers will generally assume that the entire state already exists and not try to provide defaults.\nFurther Suggestions\nAgain, it's important to understand that Redux reducers are just functions.  While combineReducers is useful, it's just one tool in the toolbox.  Functions can contain conditional logic other than switch statements, functions can be composed to wrap each other, and functions can call other functions.  Maybe you need one of your slice reducers to be able to reset its state, and to only respond to specific actions overall.  You could do:\nconst undoableFilteredSliceA = compose(undoReducer, filterReducer(\"ACTION_1\", \"ACTION_2\"), sliceReducerA);\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    a : undoableFilteredSliceA,\n    b : normalSliceReducerB\n});\n\nNote that combineReducers doesn't know or care that there's anything special about the reducer function that's responsible for managing a.  We didn't need to modify combineReducers to specifically know how to undo things - we just built up the pieces we needed into a new composed function.  \nAlso, while combineReducers is the one reducer utility function that's built into Redux, there's a wide variety of third-party reducer utilities that have published for reuse.  The Redux Addons Catalog lists many of the third-party utilities that are available.  Or, if none of the published utilities solve your use case, you can always write a function yourself that does just exactly what you need.\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/NormalizingStateShape.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/NormalizingStateShape.html","title":"Normalizing State Shape","keywords":"","body":"Normalizing State Shape\nMany applications deal with data that is nested or relational in nature.  For example, a blog editor could have many Posts, each Post could have many Comments, and both Posts and Comments would be written by a User.  Data for this kind of application might look like:\nconst blogPosts = [\n    {\n        id : \"post1\",\n        author : {username : \"user1\", name : \"User 1\"},\n        body : \"......\",\n        comments : [\n            {\n                id : \"comment1\",\n                author : {username : \"user2\", name : \"User 2\"},\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            {\n                id : \"comment2\",\n                author : {username : \"user3\", name : \"User 3\"},\n                comment : \".....\",\n            }\n        ]    \n    },\n    {\n        id : \"post2\",\n        author : {username : \"user2\", name : \"User 2\"},\n        body : \"......\",\n        comments : [\n            {\n                id : \"comment3\",\n                author : {username : \"user3\", name : \"User 3\"},\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            {\n                id : \"comment4\",\n                author : {username : \"user1\", name : \"User 1\"},\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            {\n                id : \"comment5\",\n                author : {username : \"user3\", name : \"User 3\"},\n                comment : \".....\",\n            }\n        ]    \n    }\n    // and repeat many times\n]\n\nNotice that the structure of the data is a bit complex, and some of the data is repeated.  This is a concern for several reasons:\n\nWhen a piece of data is duplicated in several places, it becomes harder to make sure that it is updated appropriately.\nNested data means that the corresponding reducer logic has to be more nested and therefore more complex. In particular, trying to update a deeply nested field can become very ugly very fast.\nSince immutable data updates require all ancestors in the state tree to be copied and updated as well, and new object references will cause connected UI components to re-render, an update to a deeply nested data object could force totally unrelated UI components to re-render even if the data they're displaying hasn't actually changed.\n\nBecause of this, the recommended approach to managing relational or nested data in a Redux store is to treat a portion of your store as if it were a database, and keep that data in a normalized form.  \nDesigning a Normalized State\nThe basic concepts of normalizing data are:\n\nEach type of data gets its own \"table\" in the state.\nEach \"data table\" should store the individual items in an object, with the IDs of the items as keys and the items themselves as the values.\nAny references to individual items should be done by storing the item's ID.\nArrays of IDs should be used to indicate ordering.\n\nAn example of a normalized state structure for the blog example above might look like:\n{\n    posts : {\n        byId : {\n            \"post1\" : {\n                id : \"post1\",\n                author : \"user1\",\n                body : \"......\",\n                comments : [\"comment1\", \"comment2\"]    \n            },\n            \"post2\" : {\n                id : \"post2\",\n                author : \"user2\",\n                body : \"......\",\n                comments : [\"comment3\", \"comment4\", \"comment5\"]    \n            }\n        },\n        allIds : [\"post1\", \"post2\"]\n    },\n    comments : {\n        byId : {\n            \"comment1\" : {\n                id : \"comment1\",\n                author : \"user2\",\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            \"comment2\" : {\n                id : \"comment2\",\n                author : \"user3\",\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            \"comment3\" : {\n                id : \"comment3\",\n                author : \"user3\",\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            \"comment4\" : {\n                id : \"comment4\",\n                author : \"user1\",\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n            \"comment5\" : {\n                id : \"comment5\",\n                author : \"user3\",\n                comment : \".....\",\n            },\n        },\n        allIds : [\"comment1\", \"comment2\", \"comment3\", \"commment4\", \"comment5\"]\n    },\n    users : {\n        byId : {\n            \"user1\" : {\n                username : \"user1\",\n                name : \"User 1\",\n            }\n            \"user2\" : {\n                username : \"user2\",\n                name : \"User 2\",\n            }\n            \"user3\" : {\n                username : \"user3\",\n                name : \"User 3\",\n            }\n        },\n        allIds : [\"user1\", \"user2\", \"user3\"]\n    }\n}\n\nThis state structure is much flatter overall.  Compared to the original nested format, this is an improvement in several ways:\n\nBecause each item is only defined in one place, we don't have to try to make changes in multiple places if that item is updated.\nThe reducer logic doesn't have to deal with deep levels of nesting, so it will probably be much simpler.\nThe logic for retrieving or updating a given item is now fairly simple and consistent.  Given an item's type and its ID, we can directly look it up in a couple simple steps, without having to dig through other objects to find it.\nSince each data type is separated, an update like changing the text of a comment would only require new copies of the \"comments > byId > comment\" portion of the tree.  This will generally mean fewer portions of the UI that need to update because their data has changed.  In contrast, updating a comment in the original nested shape would have required updating the comment object, the parent post object, the array of all post objects, and likely have caused all of the Post components and Comment components in the UI to re-render themselves.\n\nNote that a normalized state structure generally implies that more components are connected and each component is responsible for looking up its own data, as opposed to a few connected components looking up large amounts of data and passing all that data downwards.  As it turns out, having connected parent components simply pass item IDs to connected children is a good pattern for optimizing UI performance in a React Redux application, so keeping state normalized plays a key role in improving performance.\nOrganizing Normalized Data in State\nA typical application will likely have a mixture of relational data and non-relational data.  While there is no single rule for exactly how those different types of data should be organized, one common pattern is to put the relational \"tables\" under a common parent key, such as \"entities\".  A state structure using this approach might look like:\n{\n    simpleDomainData1: {....},\n    simpleDomainData2: {....}\n    entities : {\n        entityType1 : {....},\n        entityType2 : {....}\n    }\n    ui : {\n        uiSection1 : {....},\n        uiSection2 : {....}\n    }\n}\n\nThis could be expanded in a number of ways.  For example, an application that does a lot of editing of entities might want to keep two sets of \"tables\" in the state, one for the \"current\" item values and one for the \"work-in-progress\" item values.  When an item is edited, its values could be copied into the \"work-in-progress\" section, and any actions that update it would be applied to the \"work-in-progress\" copy, allowing the editing form to be controlled by that set of data while another part of the UI still refers to the original version.  \"Resetting\" the edit form would simply require removing the item from the \"work-in-progress\" section and re-copying the original data from \"current\" to \"work-in-progress\", while \"applying\" the edits would involve copying the values from the \"work-in-progress\" section to the \"current\" section.\nRelationships and Tables\nBecause we're treating a portion of our Redux store as a \"database\", many of the principles of database design also apply here as well.  For example, if we have a many-to-many relationship, we can model that using an intermediate table that stores the IDs of the corresponding items (often known as a \"join table\" or an \"associative table\").  For consistency, we would probably also want to use the same byId and allIds approach that we used for the actual item tables, like this:\n{\n    entities: {\n        authors : { byId : {}, allIds : [] },\n        books : { byId : {}, allIds : [] },\n        authorBook : {\n            byId : {\n                1 : {\n                    id : 1,\n                    authorId : 5,\n                    bookId : 22\n                },\n                2 : {\n                    id : 2,\n                    authorId : 5,\n                    bookId : 15,\n                }\n                3 : {\n                    id : 3,\n                    authorId : 42,\n                    bookId : 12\n                }\n            },\n            allIds : [1, 2, 3]\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nOperations like \"Look up all books by this author\", can then be accomplished easily with a single loop over the join table.  Given the typical amounts of data in a client application and the speed of Javascript engines, this kind of operation is likely to have sufficiently fast performance for most use cases.\nNormalizing Nested Data\nBecause APIs frequently send back data in a nested form, that data needs to be transformed into a normalized shape before it can be included in the state tree.  The Normalizr library is usually used for this task.  You can define schema types and relations, feed the schema and the response data to Normalizr, and it will output a normalized transformation of the response.  That output can then be included in an action and used to update the store.  See the Normalizr documentation for more details on its usage.\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/UpdatingNormalizedData.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/UpdatingNormalizedData.html","title":"Updating Normalized Data","keywords":"","body":"Managing Normalized Data\nAs mentioned in Normalizing State Shape, the Normalizr library is frequently used to transform nested response data into a normalized shape suitable for integration into the store.  However, that doesn't address the issue of executing further updates to that normalized data as it's being used elsewhere in the application.  There are a variety of different approaches that you can use, based on your own preference.  We'll use the example of adding a new Comment to a Post.\nStandard Approaches\nSimple Merging\nOne approach is to merge the contents of the action into the existing state.  In this case, we need to do a deep recursive merge, not just a shallow copy.  The Lodash merge function can handle this for us:\nimport merge from \"lodash/merge\";\n\nfunction commentsById(state = {}, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        default : {\n           if(action.entities && action.entities.comments) {\n               return merge({}, state, action.entities.comments.byId);\n           }\n           return state;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis requires the least amount of work on the reducer side, but does require that the action creator potentially do a fair amount of work to organize the data into the correct shape before the action is dispatched.  It also doesn't handle trying to delete an item.\nSlice Reducer Composition\nIf we have a nested tree of slice reducers, each slice reducer will need to know how to respond to this action appropriately.  We will need to include all the relevant data in the action.  We need to update the correct Post object with the comment's ID, create a new Comment object using that ID as a key, and include the Comment's ID in the list of all Comment IDs.  Here's how the pieces for this might fit together:\n// actions.js\nfunction addComment(postId, commentText) {\n    // Generate a unique ID for this comment\n    const commentId = generateId(\"comment\");\n\n    return {\n        type : \"ADD_COMMENT\",\n        payload : {\n            postId,\n            commentId,\n            commentText\n        }\n    };\n}\n\n\n// reducers/posts.js\nfunction addComment(state, action) {\n    const {payload} = action;\n    const {postId, commentId} = payload;\n\n    // Look up the correct post, to simplify the rest of the code\n    const post = state[postId];\n\n    return {\n        ...state,\n        // Update our Post object with a new \"comments\" array\n        [postId] : {\n             ...post,\n             comments : post.comments.concat(commentId)             \n        }\n    };\n}\n\nfunction postsById(state = {}, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case \"ADD_COMMENT\" : return addComment(state, action);\n        default : return state;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction allPosts(state = [], action) {\n    // omitted - no work to be done for this example\n}\n\nconst postsReducer = combineReducers({\n    byId : postsById,\n    allIds : allPosts\n});\n\n\n// reducers/comments.js\nfunction addCommentEntry(state, action) {\n    const {payload} = action;\n    const {commentId, commentText} = payload;\n\n    // Create our new Comment object\n    const comment = {id : commentId, text : commentText};\n\n    // Insert the new Comment object into the updated lookup table\n    return {\n        ...state,\n        [commentId] : comment\n    };\n}\n\nfunction commentsById(state = {}, action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case \"ADD_COMMENT\" : return addCommentEntry(state, action);\n        default : return state;\n    }\n}\n\n\nfunction addCommentId(state, action) {\n    const {payload} = action;\n    const {commentId} = payload;\n    // Just append the new Comment's ID to the list of all IDs\n    return state.concat(commentId);\n}\n\nfunction allComments(state = [], action) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case \"ADD_COMMENT\" : return addCommentId(state, action);\n        default : return state;\n    }\n}\n\nconst commentsReducer = combineReducers({\n    byId : commentsById,\n    allIds : allComments\n});\n\nThe example is a bit long, because it's showing how all the different slice reducers and case reducers fit together.  Note  the delegation involved here.  The postsById slice reducer delegates the work for this case to addComment, which inserts the new Comment's ID into the correct Post item.  Meanwhile, both the commentsById and allComments slice reducers have their own case reducers, which update the Comments lookup table and list of all Comment IDs appropriately.\nOther Approaches\nTask-Based Updates\nSince reducers are just functions, there's an infinite number of ways to split up this logic.  While using slice reducers is obviously the most common, it's also possible to organize behavior in a more task-oriented structure.  Because this will often involve more nested updates, you may want to use an immutable update utility library like dot-prop-immutable or object-path-immutable to simplify the update statements.  Here's an example of what that might look like:\nimport posts from \"./postsReducer\";\nimport comments from \"./commentsReducer\";\nimport dotProp from \"dot-prop-immutable\";\nimport {combineReducers} from \"redux\";\nimport reduceReducers from \"reduce-reducers\";\n\nconst combinedReducer = combineReducers({\n    posts,\n    comments\n});\n\n\nfunction addComment(state, action) {\n    const {payload} = action;\n    const {postId, commentId, commentText} = payload;\n\n    // State here is the entire combined state\n    const updatedWithPostState = dotProp.set(\n        state, \n        `posts.byId.${postId}.comments`, \n        comments => comments.concat(commentId)\n    );\n\n    const updatedWithCommentsTable = dotProp.set(\n        updatedWithPostState, \n        `comments.byId.${commentId}`,\n        {id : commentId, text : commentText}\n    );\n\n    const updatedWithCommentsList = dotProp.set(\n        updatedWithCommentsTable,\n        `comments.allIds`,\n        allIds => allIds.concat(commentId);\n    );\n\n    return updatedWithCommentsList;\n}\n\nconst featureReducers = createReducer({}, {\n    ADD_COMMENT : addComment,\n};\n\nconst rootReducer = reduceReducers(\n    combinedReducer,\n    featureReducers\n);\n\nThis approach makes it very clear what's happening for the \"ADD_COMMENTS\" case, but it does require nested updating logic, and some specific knowledge of the state tree shape.  Depending on how you want to compose your reducer logic, this may or may not be desired.\nRedux-ORM\nThe Redux-ORM library provides a very useful abstraction layer for managing normalized data in a Redux store.  It allows you to declare Model classes and define relations between them.  It can then generate the empty \"tables\" for your data types, act as a specialized selector tool for looking up the data, and perform immutable updates on that data.\nThere's a couple ways Redux-ORM can be used to perform updates.  First, the Redux-ORM docs suggest defining reducer functions on each Model subclass, then including the auto-generated combined reducer function into your store:\n// models.js\nimport {Model, many, Schema} from \"redux-orm\";\n\nexport class Post extends Model {\n  static get fields() {\n    return {\n      // Define a many-sided relation - one Post can have many Comments, \n      // at a field named \"comments\"\n      comments : many(\"Comment\") \n    };\n  }\n\n  static reducer(state, action, Post) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n      case \"CREATE_POST\" : {\n        // Queue up the creation of a Post instance\n        Post.create(action.payload);\n        break;\n      }\n      case \"ADD_COMMENT\" : {\n        const {payload} = action;\n        const {postId, commentId} = payload;\n        // Queue up the addition of a relation between this Comment ID \n        // and this Post instance\n        Post.withId(postId).comments.add(commentId);\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Redux-ORM will automatically apply queued updates after this returns\n  }\n}\nPost.modelName = \"Post\";\n\nexport class Comment extends Model {\n  static get fields() {\n    return {};\n  }\n\n  static reducer(state, action, Comment) {\n    switch(action.type) {\n      case \"ADD_COMMENT\" : {\n        const {payload} = action;\n        const {commentId, commentText} = payload;\n\n        // Queue up the creation of a Comment instance\n        Comment.create({id : commentId, text : commentText});\n        break;\n      }   \n    }\n\n    // Redux-ORM will automatically apply queued updates after this returns\n  }\n}\nComment.modelName = \"Comment\";\n\n// Create a Schema instance, and hook up the Post and Comment models\nexport const schema = new Schema();\nschema.register(Post, Comment);\n\n\n// main.js\nimport { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux'\nimport {schema} from \"./models\";\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n  // Insert the auto-generated Redux-ORM reducer.  This will\n  // initialize our model \"tables\", and hook up the reducer\n  // logic we defined on each Model subclass\n  entities : schema.reducer()\n});\n\n// Dispatch an action to create a Post instance\nstore.dispatch({\n  type : \"CREATE_POST\",\n  payload : {\n    id : 1,\n    name : \"Test Post Please Ignore\" \n  }\n});\n\n// Dispatch an action to create a Comment instance as a child of that Post\nstore.dispatch({\n  type : \"ADD_COMMENT\",\n  payload : {\n    postId : 1,\n    commentId : 123,\n    commentText : \"This is a comment\"\n  }\n});\n\nThe Redux-ORM library maintains an internal queue of updates to be applied.  Those updates are then applied immutably, simplifying the update process.\nAnother variation on this is to use Redux-ORM as an abstraction layer within a single case reducer:\nimport {schema} from \"./models\";\n\n// Assume this case reducer is being used in our \"entities\" slice reducer, \n// and we do not have reducers defined on our Redux-ORM Model subclasses\nfunction addComment(entitiesState, action) {\n    const session = schema.from(entitiesState);\n    const {Post, Comment} = session;\n    const {payload} = action;\n    const {postId, commentId, commentText} = payload;\n\n    const post = Post.withId(postId);\n    post.comments.add(commentId);\n\n    Comment.create({id : commentId, text : commentText});\n\n    return session.reduce();\n}\n\nOverall, Redux-ORM provides a very useful set of abstractions for defining relations between data types, creating the \"tables\" in our state, retrieving and denormalizing relational data, and applying immutable updates to relational data.\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/ReusingReducerLogic.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/ReusingReducerLogic.html","title":"Reusing Reducer Logic","keywords":"","body":"Reusing Reducer Logic\nAs an application grows, common patterns in reducer logic will start to emerge.  You may find several parts of your reducer logic doing the same kinds of work for different types of data, and want to reduce duplication by reusing the same common logic for each data type.  Or, you may want to have multiple \"instances\" of a certain type of data being handled in the store.  However, the global structure of a Redux store comes with some trade-offs: it makes it easy to track the overall state of an application, but can also make it harder to \"target\" actions that need to update a specific piece of state, particularly if you are using combineReducers.\nAs an example, let's say that we want to track multiple counters in our application, named A, B, and C.  We define our initial counter reducer, and we use combineReducers to set up our state:\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n    switch (action.type) {\n        case 'INCREMENT':\n            return state + 1;\n        case 'DECREMENT':\n            return state - 1;\n        default:\n            return state;\n    }\n}\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    counterA : counter,\n    counterB : counter,\n    counterC : counter\n});\n\nUnfortunately, this setup has a problem.  Because combineReducers will call each slice reducer with the same action, dispatching {type : 'INCREMENT'} will actually cause all three counter values to be incremented, not just one of them.  We need some way to wrap the counter logic so that we can ensure that only the counter we care about is updated.\nCustomizing Behavior with Higher-Order Reducers\nAs defined in Splitting Reducer Logic, a higher-order reducer is a function that takes a reducer function as an argument, and/or returns a new reducer function as a result.  It can also be viewed as a \"reducer factory\".  combineReducers is one example of a higher-order reducer.  We can use this pattern to create specialized versions of our own reducer functions, with each version only responding to specific actions.\nThe two most common ways to specialize a reducer are to generate new action constants with a given prefix or suffix, or to attach additional info inside the action object.  Here's what those might look like:\nfunction createCounterWithNamedType(counterName = '') {\n    return function counter(state = 0, action) {\n        switch (action.type) {\n            case `INCREMENT_${counterName}`:\n                return state + 1;\n            case `DECREMENT_${counterName}`:\n                return state - 1;\n            default:\n                return state;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunction createCounterWithNameData(counterName = '') {\n    return function counter(state = 0, action) {\n        const {name} = action;\n        if(name !== counterName) return state;\n\n        switch (action.type) {\n            case `INCREMENT`:\n                return state + 1;\n            case `DECREMENT`:\n                return state - 1;\n            default:\n                return state;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWe should now be able to use either of these to generate our specialized counter reducers, and then dispatch actions that will affect the portion of the state that we care about:\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    counterA : createCounterWithNamedType('A'),\n    counterB : createCounterWithNamedType('B'),\n    counterC : createCounterWithNamedType('C'),\n});\n\nstore.dispatch({type : 'INCREMENT_B'});\nconsole.log(store.getState());\n// {counterA : 0, counterB : 1, counterC : 0}\n\nWe could also vary the approach somewhat, and create a more generic higher-order reducer that accepts both a given reducer function and a name or identifier:\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n    switch (action.type) {\n        case 'INCREMENT':\n            return state + 1;\n        case 'DECREMENT':\n            return state - 1;\n        default:\n            return state;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction createNamedWrapperReducer(reducerFunction, reducerName) {\n    return (state, action) => {\n        const {name} = action;\n        const isInitializationCall = state === undefined;\n        if(name !== reducerName && !isInitializationCall) return state;\n\n        return reducerFunction(state, action);    \n    }\n}\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    counterA : createNamedWrapperReducer(counter, 'A'),\n    counterB : createNamedWrapperReducer(counter, 'B'),\n    counterC : createNamedWrapperReducer(counter, 'C'),\n});\n\nYou could even go as far as to make a generic filtering higher-order reducer:\nfunction createFilteredReducer(reducerFunction, reducerPredicate) {\n    return (state, action) => {\n        const isInitializationCall = state === undefined;\n        const shouldRunWrappedReducer = reducerPredicate(action) || isInitializationCall;\n        return shouldRunWrappedReducer ? reducerFunction(state, action) : state;\n    }\n}\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n    // check for suffixed strings\n    counterA : createFilteredReducer(counter, action => action.type.endsWith('_A')),\n    // check for extra data in the action\n    counterB : createFilteredReducer(counter, action => action.name === 'B'),\n    // respond to all 'INCREMENT' actions, but never 'DECREMENT'\n    counterC : createFilteredReducer(counter, action => action.type === 'INCREMENT')\n};\n\nThese basic patterns allow you to do things like having multiple instances of a smart connected component within the UI, or reuse common logic for generic capabilities such as pagination or sorting.\nIn addition to generating reducers this way, you might also want to generate action creators using the same approach, and could generate them both at the same time with helper functions. See Action/Reducer Generators and Reducers libraries for action/reducer utilities.\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/ImmutableUpdatePatterns.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/ImmutableUpdatePatterns.html","title":"Immutable Update Patterns","keywords":"","body":"Immutable Update Patterns\nThe articles listed in Prerequisite Concepts#Immutable Data Management give a number of good examples for how to perform basic update operations immutably, such as updating a field in an object or adding an item to the end of an array.  However, reducers will often need to use those basic operations in combination to perform more complicated tasks.  Here are some examples for some of the more common tasks you might have to implement.\nUpdating Nested Objects\nThe key to updating nested data is that every level of nesting must be copied and updated appropriately.  This is often a difficult concept for those learning Redux, and there are some specific problems that frequently occur when trying to update nested objects.  These lead to accidental direct mutation, and should be avoided.\nCommon Mistake #1: New variables that point to the same objects\nDefining a new variable does not create a new actual object - it only creates another reference to the same object.  An example of this error would be:\nfunction updateNestedState(state, action) {\n    let nestedState = state.nestedState;\n    // ERROR: this directly modifies the existing object reference - don't do this!\n    nestedState.nestedField = action.data;\n\n    return {\n        ...state,\n        nestedState\n    };\n}\n\nThis function does correctly return a shallow copy of the top-level state object, but because the nestedState variable was still pointing at the existing object, the state was directly mutated.  \nCommon Mistake #2: Only making a shallow copy of one level\nAnother common version of this error looks like this:\nfunction updateNestedState(state, action) {\n    // Problem: this only does a shallow copy!\n    let newState = {...state};\n\n    // ERROR: nestedState is still the same object!\n    newState.nestedState.nestedField = action.data;\n\n    return newState;\n}\n\nDoing a shallow copy of the top level is not sufficient - the nestedState object should be copied as well.\nCorrect Approach: Copying All Levels of Nested Data\nUnfortunately, the process of correctly applying immutable updates to deeply nested state can easily become verbose and hard to read.  Here's what an example of updating state.first.second[someId].fourth might look like:\nfunction updateVeryNestedField(state, action) {\n    return {\n        ...state,\n        first : {\n            ...state.first,\n            second : {\n                ...state.first.second,\n                [action.someId] : {\n                    ...state.first.second[action.someId],\n                    fourth : action.someValue\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nObviously, each layer of nesting makes this harder to read, and gives more chances to make mistakes.  This is one of several reasons why you are encouraged to keep your state flattened, and compose reducers as much as possible.\nInserting and Removing Items in Arrays\nNormally, a Javascript array's contents are modified using mutative functions like push, unshift, and splice.  Since we don't want to mutate state directly in reducers, those should normally be avoided.  Because of that, you might see \"insert\" or \"remove\" behavior written like this:\nfunction insertItem(array, action) {\n    return [\n        ...array.slice(0, action.index),\n        action.item,\n        ...array.slice(action.index)\n    ]\n}\n\nfunction removeItem(array, action) {\n    return [\n        ...array.slice(0, action.index),\n        ...array.slice(action.index + 1)\n    ];\n}\n\nHowever, remember that the key is that the original in-memory reference is not modified.  As long as we make a copy first, we can safely mutate the copy.  Note that this is true for both arrays and objects, but nested values still must be updated using the same rules.\nThis means that we could also write the insert and remove functions like this:\nfunction insertItem(array, action) {\n    let newArray = array.slice();\n    newArray.splice(action.index, 0, action.item);\n    return newArray;\n}\n\nfunction removeItem(array, action) {\n    let newArray = array.slice();\n    newArray.splice(action.index, 1);\n    return newArray;\n}\n\nThe remove function could also be implemented as:\nfunction removeItem(array, action) {\n    return array.filter( (item, index) => index !== action.index);\n}\n\nUpdating an Item in an Array\nUpdating one item in an array can be accomplished by using Array.map, returning a new value for the item we want to update, and returning the existing values for all other items:\nfunction updateObjectInArray(array, action) {\n    return array.map( (item, index) => {\n        if(index !== action.index) {\n            // This isn't the item we care about - keep it as-is\n            return item;\n        }\n\n        // Otherwise, this is the one we want - return an updated value\n        return {\n            ...item,\n            ...action.item\n        };    \n    });\n}\n\nImmutable Update Utility Libraries\nBecause writing immutable update code can become tedious, there are a number of utility libraries that try to abstract out the process.  These libraries vary in APIs and usage, but all try to provide a shorter and more succinct way of writing these updates.  Some, like dot-prop-immutable, take string paths for commands:\nstate = dotProp.set(state, `todos.${index}.complete`, true)\n\nOthers, like immutability-helper (a fork of the now-deprecated React Immutability Helpers addon), use nested values and helper functions:\nvar collection = [1, 2, {a: [12, 17, 15]}];\nvar newCollection = update(collection, {2: {a: {$splice: [[1, 1, 13, 14]]}}});\n\nThey can provide a useful alternative to writing manual immutable update logic.\nA list of many immutable update utilities can be found in the Immutable Data#Immutable Update Utilities section of the Redux Addons Catalog.\n"},"docs/recipes/reducers/InitializingState.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/reducers/InitializingState.html","title":"Initializing State","keywords":"","body":"Initializing State\nThere are two main ways to initialize state for your application.  The createStore method can accept an optional preloadedState value as its second argument.  Reducers can also specify an initial value by looking for an incoming state argument that is undefined, and returning the value they'd like to use as a default.  This can either be done with an explicit check inside the reducer, or by using the ES6 default argument value syntax: function myReducer(state = someDefaultValue, action).\nIt's not always immediately clear how these two approaches interact.  Fortunately, the process does follow some predictable rules.  Here's how the pieces fit together.\nSummary\nWithout combineReducers() or similar manual code, preloadedState always wins over state = ... in the reducer because the state passed to the reducer is preloadedState and is not undefined, so the ES6 argument syntax doesn't apply.\nWith combineReducers() the behavior is more nuanced. Those reducers whose state is specified in preloadedState will receive that state. Other reducers will receive undefined and because of that will fall back to the state = ... default argument they specify.\nIn general, preloadedState wins over the state specified by the reducer. This lets reducers specify initial data that makes sense to them as default arguments, but also allows loading existing data (fully or partially) when you're hydrating the store from some persistent storage or the server.\nNote: Reducers whose initial state is populated using preloadedState will still need to provide a default value to handle when passed a state of undefined. All reducers are passed undefined on initialization, so they should be written such that when given undefined, some value should be returned. This can be any non-undefined value; there's no need to duplicate the section of preloadedState here as the default.\nIn Depth\nSingle Simple Reducer\nFirst let's consider a case where you have a single reducer.  Say you don't use combineReducers().\nThen your reducer might look like this:\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n  case 'INCREMENT': return state + 1;\n  case 'DECREMENT': return state - 1;\n  default: return state;\n  }\n}\n\nNow let's say you create a store with it.\nimport { createStore } from 'redux';\nlet store = createStore(counter);\nconsole.log(store.getState()); // 0\n\nThe initial state is zero. Why?   Because the second argument to createStore was undefined. This is the state passed to your reducer the first time. When Redux initializes it dispatches a \"dummy\" action to fill the state. So your counter reducer was called with state equal to undefined. This is exactly the case that \"activates\" the default argument. Therefore, state is now 0 as per the default state value (state = 0). This state (0) will be returned.\nLet's consider a different scenario:\nimport { createStore } from 'redux';\nlet store = createStore(counter, 42);\nconsole.log(store.getState()); // 42\n\nWhy is it 42, and not 0, this time? Because createStore was called with 42 as the second argument. This argument becomes the state passed to your reducer along with the dummy action. This time, state is not undefined (it's 42!), so ES6 default argument syntax has no effect. The state is 42, and 42 is returned from the reducer.\nCombined Reducers\nNow let's consider a case where you use combineReducers().You have two reducers:\nfunction a(state = 'lol', action) {\n  return state;\n}\n\nfunction b(state = 'wat', action) {\n  return state;\n}\n\nThe reducer generated by combineReducers({ a, b }) looks like this:\n// const combined = combineReducers({ a, b })\nfunction combined(state = {}, action) {\n  return {\n    a: a(state.a, action),\n    b: b(state.b, action)\n  };\n}\n\nIf we call createStore without the preloadedState, it's going to initialize the state to {}. Therefore, state.a and state.b will be undefined by the time it calls a and b reducers. Both a and b reducers will receive undefined as their state arguments, and if they specify default state values, those will be returned. This is how the combined reducer returns a { a: 'lol', b: 'wat' } state object on the first invocation.\nimport { createStore } from 'redux';\nlet store = createStore(combined);\nconsole.log(store.getState()); // { a: 'lol', b: 'wat' }\n\nLet's consider a different scenario:\nimport { createStore } from 'redux';\nlet store = createStore(combined, { a: 'horse' });\nconsole.log(store.getState()); // { a: 'horse', b: 'wat' }\n\nNow I specified the preloadedState as the argument to createStore(). The state returned from the combined reducer combines the initial state I specified for the a reducer with the 'wat' default argument specified that b reducer chose itself.\nLet's recall what the combined reducer does:\n// const combined = combineReducers({ a, b })\nfunction combined(state = {}, action) {\n  return {\n    a: a(state.a, action),\n    b: b(state.b, action)\n  };\n}\n\nIn this case, state was specified so it didn't fall back to {}. It was an object with a field equal to 'horse', but without the b field. This is why the a reducer received 'horse' as its state and gladly returned it, but the b reducer received undefined as its state and thus returned its idea of the default state (in our example, 'wat'). This is how we get { a: 'horse', b: 'wat' } in return.\nRecap\nTo sum this up, if you stick to Redux conventions and return the initial state from reducers when they're called with undefined as the state argument (the easiest way to implement this is to specify the state ES6 default argument value), you're going to have a nice useful behavior for combined reducers. They will prefer the corresponding value in the preloadedState object you pass to the createStore() function, but if you didn't pass any, or if the corresponding field is not set, the default state argument specified by the reducer is chosen instead. This approach works well because it provides both initialization and hydration of existing data, but lets individual reducers reset their state if their data was not preserved. Of course you can apply this pattern recursively, as you can use combineReducers() on many levels, or even compose reducers manually by calling reducers and giving them the relevant part of the state tree.\n"},"docs/recipes/UsingImmutableJS.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/UsingImmutableJS.html","title":"Using Immutable.JS with Redux","keywords":"","body":"Using Immutable.JS with Redux\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy should I use an immutable-focused library such as Immutable.JS?\nWhy should I choose Immutable.JS as an immutable library?\nWhat are the issues with using Immutable.JS?\nIs Immutable.JS worth the effort?\nWhat are some opinionated Best Practices for using Immutable.JS with Redux?\n\n\nWhy should I use an immutable-focused library such as Immutable.JS?\nImmutable-focused libraries such as Immutable.JS have been designed to overcome the issues with immutability inherent within JavaScript, providing all the benefits of immutability with the performance your app requires.\nWhether you choose to use such a library, or stick with plain JavaScript, depends on how comfortable you are with adding another dependency to your app, or how sure you are that you can avoid the pitfalls inherent within JavaScript’s approach to immutability.\nWhichever option you choose, make sure you’re familiar with the concepts of immutability, side effects and mutation. In particular, ensure you have a deep understanding of what JavaScript does when updating and copying values in order to guard against accidental mutations that will degrade your app’s performance, or break it altogether.\nFurther Information\nDocumentation\n\nRecipes: immutability, side effects and mutation\n\nArticles\n\nIntroduction to Immutable.js and Functional Programming Concepts\nPros and Cons of using immutability with React.js\n\n\nWhy should I choose Immutable.JS as an immutable library?\nImmutable.JS was designed to provide immutability in a performant manner in an effort to overcome the limitations of immutability with JavaScript. Its principle advantages include:\nGuaranteed immutability\nData encapsulated in an Immutable.JS object is never mutated. A new copy is always returned. This contrasts with JavaScript, in which some operations do not mutate your data (e.g. some Array methods, including map, filter, concat, forEach, etc.), but some do (Array’s pop, push, splice, etc.).\nRich API\nImmutable.JS provides a rich set of immutable objects to encapsulate your data (e.g. Maps, Lists, Sets, Records, etc.), and an extensive set of methods to manipulate it, including methods to sort, filter, and group the data, reverse it, flatten it, and create subsets.\nPerformance\nImmutable.JS does a lot of work behind the scenes to optimize performance. This is the key to its power, as using immutable data structures can involve a lot of expensive copying. In particular, immutably manipulating large, complex data sets, such as a nested Redux state tree, can generate many intermediate copies of objects, which consume memory and slow down performance as the browser’s garbage collector fights to clean things up.\nImmutable.JS avoids this by cleverly sharing data structures under the surface, minimizing the need to copy data. It also enables complex chains of operations to be carried out without creating unnecessary (and costly) cloned intermediate data that will quickly be thrown away.\nYou never see this, of course - the data you give to an Immutable.JS object is never mutated. Rather, it’s the intermediate data generated within Immutable.JS from a chained sequence of method calls that is free to be mutated. You therefore get all the benefits of immutable data structures with none (or very little) of the potential performance hits.\nFurther Information\nArticles\n\nImmutable.js, persistent data structures and structural sharing\nPDF: JavaScript Immutability - Don’t go changing\n\nLibraries\n\nImmutable.js\n\n\nWhat are the issues with using Immutable.JS?\nAlthough powerful, Immutable.JS needs to be used carefully, as it comes with issues of its own. Note, however, that all of these issues can be overcome quite easily with careful coding.\nDifficult to interoperate with\nJavaScript does not provide immutable data structures. As such, for Immutable.JS to provide its immutable guarantees, your data must be encapsulated within an Immutable.JS object (such as a Map or a List, etc.). Once it’s contained in this way, it’s hard for that data to then interoperate with other, plain JavaScript objects.\nFor example, you will no longer be able to reference an object’s properties through standard JavaScript dot or bracket notation. Instead, you must reference them via Immutable.JS’s get() or getIn() methods, which use an awkward syntax that accesses properties via an array of strings, each of which represents a property key.\nFor example, instead of myObj.prop1.prop2.prop3, you would use myImmutableMap.getIn([‘prop1’, ‘prop2’, ‘prop3’]).\nThis makes it awkward to interoperate not just with your own code, but also with other libraries, such as lodash or ramda, that expect plain JavaScript objects.\nNote that Immutable.JS objects do have a toJS() method, which returns the data as a plain JavaScript data structure, but this method is extremely slow, and using it extensively will negate the performance benefits that Immutable.JS provides\nOnce used, Immutable.JS will spread throughout your codebase\nOnce you encapsulate your data with Immutable.JS, you have to use Immutable.JS’s get() or getIn() property accessors to access it.\nThis has the effect of spreading Immutable.JS across your entire codebase, including potentially your components, where you may prefer not to have such external dependencies. Your entire codebase must know what is, and what is not, an Immutable.JS object. It also makes removing Immutable.JS from your app difficult in the future, should you ever need to.\nThis issue can be avoided by uncoupling your application logic from your data structures, as outlined in the best practices section below.\nNo Destructuring or Spread Operators\nBecause you must access your data via Immutable.JS’s own get() and getIn() methods, you can no longer use JavaScript’s destructuring operator (or the proposed Object spread operator), making your code more verbose.\nNot suitable for small values that change often\nImmutable.JS works best for collections of data, and the larger the better. It can be slow when your data comprises lots of small, simple JavaScript objects, with each comprising a few keys of primitive values.\nNote, however, that this does not apply to the Redux state tree, which is (usually) represented as a large collection of data.\nDifficult to Debug\nImmutable.JS objects, such as Map, List, etc., can be difficult to debug, as inspecting such an object will reveal an entire nested hierarchy of Immutable.JS-specific properties that you don’t care about, while your actual data that you do care about is encapsulated several layers deep.\nTo resolve this issue, use a browser extension such as the Immutable.js Object Formatter, which surfaces your data in Chrome Dev Tools, and hides Immutable.JS’s properties when inspecting your data.\nBreaks object references, causing poor performance\nOne of the key advantages of immutability is that it enables shallow equality checking, which dramatically improves performance.\nIf two different variables reference the same immutable object, then a simple equality check of the two variables is enough to determine that they are equal, and that the object they both reference is unchanged. The equality check never has to check the values of any of the object’s properties, as it is, of course, immutable.\nHowever, shallow checking will not work if your data encapsulated within an Immutable.JS object is itself an object. This is because Immutable.JS’s toJS() method, which returns the data contained within an Immutable.JS object as a JavaScript value, will create a new object every time it’s called, and so break the reference with the encapsulated data.\nAccordingly, calling toJS() twice, for example, and assigning the result to two different variables will cause an equality check on those two variables to fail, even though the object values themselves haven’t changed.\nThis is a particular issue if you use toJS() in a wrapped component’s mapStateToProps function, as React-Redux shallowly compares each value in the returned props object.  For example, the value referenced by the todos prop returned from mapStateToProps below will always be a different object, and so will fail a shallow equality check.\n// AVOID .toJS() in mapStateToProps\nfunction mapStateToProps(state) {\n  return {\n    todos: state.get('todos').toJS() // Always a new object\n  }\n}\n\nWhen the shallow check fails, React-Redux will cause the component to re-render. Using toJS() in mapStateToProps in this way, therefore, will always cause the component to re-render, even if the value never changes, impacting heavily on performance.\nThis can be prevented by using toJS() in a Higher Order Component, as discussed in the Best Practices section below.\nFurther Information\nArticles\n\nImmutable.js, persistent data structures and structural sharing\nImmutable Data Structures and JavaScript\nReact.js pure render performance anti-pattern\nBuilding Efficient UI with React and Redux\n\nChrome Extension\n\nImmutable Object Formatter\n\n\nIs Using Immutable.JS worth the effort?\nFrequently, yes. There are various tradeoffs and opinions to consider, but there are many good reasons to use Immutable.JS. Do not underestimate the difficulty of trying to track down a property of your state tree that has been inadvertently mutated.\nComponents will both re-render when they shouldn’t, and refuse to render when they should, and tracking down the bug causing the rendering issue is hard, as the component rendering incorrectly is not necessarily the one whose properties are being accidentally mutated.\nThis problem is caused predominantly by returning a mutated state object from a Redux reducer. With Immutable.JS, this problem simply does not exist, thereby removing a whole class of bugs from your app.\nThis, together with its performance and rich API for data manipulation, is why Immutable.JS is worth the effort.\nFurther Information\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting: Nothing happens when I dispatch an action\n\n\nWhat are some opinionated Best Practices for using Immutable.JS with Redux?\nImmutable.JS can provide significant reliability and performance improvements to your app, but it must be used correctly. If you choose to use Immutable.JS (and remember, you are not required to, and there are other immutable libraries you can use), follow these opinionated best practices, and you’ll be able to get the most out of it, without tripping up on any of the issues it can potentially cause.\nNever mix plain JavaScript objects with Immutable.JS\nNever let a plain JavaScript object contain Immutable.JS properties.

That something is a Higher Order Component (HOC) that simply takes the Immutable.JS props from your Smart Component, and converts them using toJS() to plain JavaScript props, which are then passed to  your Dumb Component.\nHere is an example of such a HOC:\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { Iterable } from 'immutable'\n\nexport const toJS = WrappedComponent => wrappedComponentProps => {\n  const KEY = 0\n  const VALUE = 1\n\n  const propsJS = Object.entries(\n    wrappedComponentProps\n  ).reduce((newProps, wrappedComponentProp) => {\n    newProps[wrappedComponentProp[KEY]] = Iterable.isIterable(\n      wrappedComponentProp[VALUE]\n    )\n      ? wrappedComponentProp[VALUE].toJS()\n      : wrappedComponentProp[VALUE]\n    return newProps\n  }, {})\n\n  return \n}\n\nAnd this is how you would use it in your Smart Component:\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\nimport { toJS } from './to-js'\nimport DumbComponent from './dumb.component'\n\nconst mapStateToProps = state => {\n  return {\n    // obj is an Immutable object in Smart Component, but it’s converted to a plain\n    // JavaScript object by toJS, and so passed to DumbComponent as a pure JavaScript\n    // object. Because it’s still an Immutable.JS object here in mapStateToProps, though,\n    // there is no issue with errant re-renderings.\n    obj: getImmutableObjectFromStateTree(state)\n  }\n}\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(toJS(DumbComponent))\n\nBy converting Immutable.JS objects to plain JavaScript values within a HOC, we achieve Dumb Component portability, but without the performance hits of using toJS() in the Smart Component.\nNote: if your app requires high performance, you may need to avoid toJS() altogether, and so will have to use Immutable.JS in your dumb components. However, for most apps this will not be the case, and the benefits of keeping Immutable.JS out of your dumb components (maintainability, portability and easier testing) will far outweigh any perceived performance improvements of keeping it in.\nIn addition, using toJS in a Higher Order Component should not cause much, if any, performance degradation, as the component will only be called when the connected component’s props change. As with any performance issue, conduct performance checks first before deciding what to optimize.\nFurther Information\nDocumentation\n\nReact: Higher-Order Components\n\nArticles\n\nReact Higher Order Components in depth\n\nDiscussions\n\nReddit: acemarke and cpsubrian comments on Dan Abramov: Redux is not an architecture or design pattern, it is just a library.\n\nGists\n\ncpsubrian: React decorators for redux/react-router/immutable ‘smart’ components\n\nUse the Immutable Object Formatter Chrome Extension to Aid Debugging\nInstall the Immutable Object Formatter , and inspect your Immutable.JS data without seeing the noise of Immutable.JS's own object properties.\nFurther Information\nChrome Extension\n\nImmutable Object Formatter\n\n"},"docs/FAQ.html":{"url":"docs/FAQ.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"Redux FAQ\nTable of Contents\n\nGeneral\nWhen should I learn Redux?\nWhen should I use Redux?\nCan Redux only be used with React?\nDo I need to have a particular build tool to use Redux?\n\n\nReducers\nHow do I share state between two reducers?

It helps to narrow the range of options by learning one thing at a time and focusing on problems you find in your work. Redux is a pattern for managing application state. If you do not have problems with state management, you might find the benefits of Redux harder to understand. Some UI libraries (like React) have their own state management system. If you are using one of these libraries, especially if you are just learning to use them, we encourage you to learn the capabilities of that built-in system first. It might be all you need to build your application. If your application becomes so complex that you are confused about where state is stored or how state changes, then it is a good time to learn Redux. Experiencing the complexity that Redux seeks to abstract is the best preparation for effectively applying that abstraction to your work.\nFurther information\nArticles\n\nDeciding What Not To Learn\nHow to learn web frameworks\nRedux vs MobX vs Flux vs... Do you even need that?\n\nDiscussions\n\nAsk HN: Overwhelmed with learning front-end, how do I proceed?\nTwitter: If you want to teach someone to use an abstraction...\nTwitter: it was never intended to be learned before...\nTwitter: Learning Redux before React?\nTwitter: The first time I used React, people told me I needed Redux...\nTwitter: This was my experience with Redux...\n\n\nWhen should I use Redux?\nThe need to use Redux should not be taken for granted.\nAs Pete Hunt, one of the early contributors to React, says:\n\nYou'll know when you need Flux. If you aren't sure if you need it, you don't need it.\n\nSimilarly, Dan Abramov, one of the creators of Redux, says:\n\nI would like to amend this: don't use Redux until you have problems with vanilla React.\n\nIn general, use Redux when you have reasonable amounts of data changing over time, you need a single source of truth, and you find that approaches like keeping everything in a top-level React component's state are no longer sufficient.\nHowever, it's also important to understand that using Redux comes with tradeoffs.  It's not designed to be the shortest or fastest way to write code.  It's intended to help answer the question \"When did a certain slice of state change, and where did the data come from?\", with predictable behavior.  It does so by asking you to follow specific constraints in your application: store your application's state as plain data, describe changes as plain objects, and handle those changes with pure functions that apply updates immutably.  This is often the source of complaints about \"boilerplate\".  These constraints require effort on the part of a developer, but also open up a number of additional possibilities (such as store persistence and synchronization).\nIn the end, Redux is just a tool.  It's a great tool, and there are some great reasons to use it, but there are also reasons you might not want to use it.   Make informed decisions about your tools, and understand the tradeoffs involved in each decision.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nIntroduction: Motivation\n\nArticles\n\nReact How-To\nYou Might Not Need Redux\nThe Case for Flux\nSome Reasons Why Redux is Useful in a React App\n\nDiscussions\n\nTwitter: Don't use Redux until...\nTwitter: Redux is designed to be predictable, not concise\nTwitter: Redux is useful to eliminate deep prop passing\nTwitter: Don't use Redux unless you're unhappy with local component state\nTwitter: You don't need Redux if your data never changes\nTwitter: If your reducer looks boring, don't use redux\nReddit: You don't need Redux if your app just fetches something on a single page\nStack Overflow: Why use Redux over Facebook Flux?\nStack Overflow: Why should I use Redux in this example?\nStack Overflow: What could be the downsides of using Redux instead of Flux?\nStack Overflow: When should I add Redux to a React app?\nStack Overflow: Redux vs plain React?\nTwitter: Redux is a platform for developers to build customized state management with reusable things\n\n\nCan Redux only be used with React?\nRedux can be used as a data store for any UI layer. The most common usage is with React and React Native, but there are bindings available for Angular, Angular 2, Vue, Mithril, and more. Redux simply provides a subscription mechanism which can be used by any other code. That said, it is most useful when combined with a declarative view implementation that can infer the UI updates from the state changes, such as React or one of the similar libraries available.\n\nDo I need to have a particular build tool to use Redux?\nRedux is originally written in ES6 and transpiled for production into ES5 with Webpack and Babel. You should be able to use it regardless of your JavaScript build process. Redux also offers a UMD build that can be used directly without any build process at all. The counter-vanilla example demonstrates basic ES5 usage with Redux included as a  tag. As the relevant pull request says:\n\nThe new Counter Vanilla example is aimed to dispel the myth that Redux requires Webpack, React, hot reloading, sagas, action creators, constants, Babel, npm, CSS modules, decorators, fluent Latin, an Egghead subscription, a PhD, or an Exceeds Expectations O.W.L. level.\nNope, it's just HTML, some artisanal  tags, and plain old DOM manipulation.

Do I have to use combineReducers?\nDo I have to use the switch statement to handle actions?\n\nReducers\n\nHow do I share state between two reducers? Do I have to use combineReducers?\nThe suggested structure for a Redux store is to split the state object into multiple “slices” or “domains” by key, and provide a separate reducer function to manage each individual data slice. This is similar to how the standard Flux pattern has multiple independent stores, and Redux provides the combineReducers utility function to make this pattern easier. However, it's important to note that combineReducers is not required—it is simply a utility function for the common use case of having a single reducer function per state slice, with plain JavaScript objects for the data.\nMany users later want to try to share data between two reducers, but find that combineReducers does not allow them to do so. There are several approaches that can be used:\n\nIf a reducer needs to know data from another slice of state, the state tree shape may need to be reorganized so that a single reducer is handling more of the data.\nYou may need to write some custom functions for handling some of these actions. This may require replacing combineReducers with your own top-level reducer function. You can also use a utility such as reduce-reducers to run combineReducers to handle most actions, but also run a more specialized reducer for specific actions that cross state slices.\nAsync action creators such as redux-thunk have access to the entire state through getState(). An action creator can retrieve additional data from the state and put it in an action, so that each reducer has enough information to update its own state slice.\n\nIn general, remember that reducers are just functions—you can organize them and subdivide them any way you want, and you are encouraged to break them down into smaller, reusable functions (“reducer composition”). While you do so, you may pass a custom third argument from a parent reducer if a child reducer needs additional data to calculate its next state. You just need to make sure that together they follow the basic rules of reducers: (state, action) => newState, and update state immutably rather than mutating it directly.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nAPI: combineReducers\nRecipes: Structuring Reducers\n\nDiscussions\n\n#601: A concern on combineReducers, when an action is related to multiple reducers\n#1400: Is passing top-level state object to branch reducer an anti-pattern?\nStack Overflow: Accessing other parts of the state when using combined reducers?\nStack Overflow: Reducing an entire subtree with redux combineReducers\nSharing State Between Redux Reducers\n\n\nDo I have to use the switch statement to handle actions?\nNo. You are welcome to use any approach you'd like to respond to an action in a reducer. The switch statement is the most common approach, but it's fine to use if statements, a lookup table of functions, or to create a function that abstracts this away.  In fact, while Redux does require that action objects contain a type field, your reducer logic doesn't even have to rely on that to handle the action.  That said, the standard approach is definitely using a switch statement or a lookup table based on type.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nRecipes: Reducing Boilerplate\nRecipes: Structuring Reducers - Splitting Reducer Logic\n\nDiscussions\n\n#883: take away the huge switch block\n#1167: Reducer without switch\n\n"},"docs/faq/OrganizingState.html":{"url":"docs/faq/OrganizingState.html","title":"Organizing State","keywords":"","body":"Redux FAQ: Organizing State\nTable of Contents\n\nDo I have to put all my state into Redux?

Should I ever use React's setState()?\nThere is no “right” answer for this. Some users prefer to keep every single piece of data in Redux, to maintain a fully serializable and controlled version of their application at all times. Others prefer to keep non-critical or UI state, such as “is this dropdown currently open”, inside a component's internal state. \nUsing local component state is fine.  As a developer, it is your job to determine what kinds of state make up your application, and where each piece of state should live.  Find a balance that works for you, and go with it.\nSome common rules of thumb for determining what kind of data should be put into Redux:\n\nDo other parts of the application care about this data?\nDo you need to be able to create further derived data based on this original data?\nIs the same data being used to drive multiple components?\nIs there value to you in being able to restore this state to a given point in time (ie, time travel debugging)?\nDo you want to cache the data (ie, use what's in state if it's already there instead of re-requesting it)?\n\nThere are a number of community packages that implement various approaches for storing per-component state in a Redux store instead, such as redux-ui, redux-component, redux-react-local, and more.  It's also possible to apply Redux's principles and concept of reducers to the task of updating local component state as well, along the lines of this.setState( (previousState) => reducer(previousState, someAction)).\nFurther information\nArticles\n\nYou Might Not Need Redux\nFinding state's place with React and Redux\nA Case for setState\nHow to handle state in React: the missing FAQ\nWhere to Hold React Component Data: state, store, static, and this\nThe 5 Types of React Application State\n\nDiscussions\n\n#159: Investigate using Redux for pseudo-local component state\n#1098: Using Redux in reusable React component\n#1287: How to choose between Redux's store and React's state?\n#1385: What are the disadvantages of storing all your state in a single immutable atom?\nTwitter: Should I keep something in React component state?\nTwitter: Using a reducer to update a component\nReact Forums: Redux and global state vs local state\nReddit: \"When should I put something into my Redux store?\"\nStack Overflow: Why is state all in one place, even state that isn't global?\nStack Overflow: Should all component state be kept in Redux store?\n\nLibraries\n\nRedux Addons Catalog: Component State\n\n\nCan I put functions, promises, or other non-serializable items in my store state?\nIt is highly recommended that you only put plain serializable objects, arrays, and primitives into your store.

It may help to think of parts of your store as a database, with individual “tables” per item type.

Can I get the dispatched action as part of the subscription? \n\nStore Setup\n\nCan or should I create multiple stores? Can I import my store directly, and use it in components myself?\nThe original Flux pattern describes having multiple “stores” in an app, each one holding a different area of domain data. This can introduce issues such as needing to have one store “waitFor” another store to update. This is not necessary in Redux because the separation between data domains is already achieved by splitting a single reducer into smaller reducers.\nAs with several other questions, it is possible to create multiple distinct Redux stores in a page, but the intended pattern is to have only a single store. Having a single store enables using the Redux DevTools, makes persisting and rehydrating data simpler, and simplifies the subscription logic.\nSome valid reasons for using multiple stores in Redux might include:\n\nSolving a performance issue caused by too frequent updates of some part of the state, when confirmed by profiling the app.\nIsolating a Redux app as a component in a bigger application, in which case you might want to create a store per root component instance.\n\nHowever, creating new stores shouldn't be your first instinct, especially if you come from a Flux background. Try reducer composition first, and only use multiple stores if it doesn't solve your problem.\nSimilarly, while you can reference your store instance by importing it directly, this is not a recommended pattern in Redux. If you create a store instance and export it from a module, it will become a singleton. This means it will be harder to isolate a Redux app as a component of a larger app, if this is ever necessary, or to enable server rendering, because on the server you want to create separate store instances for every request.\nWith React Redux, the wrapper classes generated by the connect() function do actually look for props.store if it exists, but it's best if you wrap your root component in  and let React Redux worry about passing the store down. This way components don't need to worry about importing a store module, and isolating a Redux app or enabling server rendering is much easier to do later.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nAPI: Store\n\nDiscussions\n\n#1346: Is it bad practice to just have a 'stores' directory?\nStack Overflow: Redux multiple stores, why not?\nStack Overflow: Accessing Redux state in an action creator\nGist: Breaking out of Redux paradigm to isolate apps\n\n\nIs it OK to have more than one middleware chain in my store enhancer? What is the difference between next and dispatch in a middleware function?\nRedux middleware act like a linked list. Each middleware function can either call next(action) to pass an action along to the next middleware in line, call dispatch(action) to restart the processing at the beginning of the list, or do nothing at all to stop the action from being processed further.\nThis chain of middleware is defined by the arguments passed to the applyMiddleware function used when creating a store. Defining multiple chains will not work correctly, as they would have distinctly different dispatch references and the different chains would effectively be disconnected.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nAdvanced: Middleware\nAPI: applyMiddleware\n\nDiscussions\n\n#1051: Shortcomings of the current applyMiddleware and composing createStore\nUnderstanding Redux Middleware\nExploring Redux Middleware\n\n\nHow do I subscribe to only a portion of the state? Can I get the dispatched action as part of the subscription?\nRedux provides a single store.subscribe method for notifying listeners that the store has updated. Listener callbacks do not receive the current state as an argument—it is simply an indication that something has changed. The subscriber logic can then call getState() to get the current state value.\nThis API is intended as a low-level primitive with no dependencies or complications, and can be used to build higher-level subscription logic. UI bindings such as React Redux can create a subscription for each connected component. It is also possible to write functions that can intelligently compare the old state vs the new state, and execute additional logic if certain pieces have changed. Examples include redux-watch, redux-subscribe and redux-subscriber which offer different approaches to specifying subscriptions and handling changes.\nThe new state is not passed to the listeners in order to simplify implementing store enhancers such as the Redux DevTools. In addition, subscribers are intended to react to the state value itself, not the action. Middleware can be used if the action is important and needs to be handled specifically.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nBasics: Store\nAPI: Store\n\nDiscussions\n\n#303: subscribe API with state as an argument\n#580: Is it possible to get action and state in store.subscribe?\n#922: Proposal: add subscribe to middleware API\n#1057: subscribe listener can get action param?\n#1300: Redux is great but major feature is missing\n\nLibraries\n\nRedux Addons Catalog: Store Change Subscriptions\n\n"},"docs/faq/Actions.html":{"url":"docs/faq/Actions.html","title":"Actions","keywords":"","body":"Redux FAQ: Actions\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy should type be a string, or at least serializable?

Why should my action types be constants?\nAs with state, serializable actions enable several of Redux's defining features, such as time travel debugging, and recording and replaying actions. Using something like a Symbol for the type value or using instanceof checks for actions themselves would break that. Strings are serializable and easily self-descriptive, and so are a better choice. Note that it is okay to use Symbols, Promises, or other non-serializable values in an action if the action is intended for use by middleware. Actions only need to be serializable by the time they actually reach the store and are passed to the reducers.\nWe can't reliably enforce serializable actions for performance reasons, so Redux only checks that every action is a plain object, and that the type is defined. The rest is up to you, but you might find that keeping everything serializable helps debug and reproduce issues.\nEncapsulating and centralizing commonly used pieces of code is a key concept in programming. While it is certainly possible to manually create action objects everywhere, and write each type value by hand, defining reusable constants makes maintaining code easier. If you put constants in a separate file, you can check your import statements against typos so you can't accidentally use the wrong string.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nReducing Boilerplate\n\nDiscussion\n\n#384: Recommend that Action constants be named in the past tense\n#628: Solution for simple action creation with less boilerplate\n#1024: Proposal: Declarative reducers\n#1167: Reducer without switch\nStack Overflow: Why do you need 'Actions' as data in Redux?\nStack Overflow: What is the point of the constants in Redux?\n\n\nIs there always a one-to-one mapping between reducers and actions?\nNo. We suggest you write independent small reducer functions that are each responsible for updates to a specific slice of state. We call this pattern “reducer composition”. A given action could be handled by all, some, or none of them. This keeps components decoupled from the actual data changes, as one action may affect different parts of the state tree, and there is no need for the component to be aware of this. Some users do choose to bind them more tightly together, such as the “ducks” file structure, but there is definitely no one-to-one mapping by default, and you should break out of such a paradigm any time you feel you want to handle an action in many reducers.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nBasics: Reducers\nRecipes: Structuring Reducers\n\nDiscussions\n\nTwitter: most common Redux misconception\n#1167: Reducer without switch\nReduxible #8: Reducers and action creators aren't a one-to-one mapping\nStack Overflow: Can I dispatch multiple actions without Redux Thunk middleware?\n\n\nHow can I represent “side effects” such as AJAX calls? Why do we need things like “action creators”, “thunks”, and “middleware” to do async behavior?\nThis is a long and complex topic, with a wide variety of opinions on how code should be organized and what approaches should be used.\nAny meaningful web app needs to execute complex logic, usually including asynchronous work such as making AJAX requests. That code is no longer purely a function of its inputs, and the interactions with the outside world are known as “side effects”\nRedux is inspired by functional programming, and out of the box, has no place for side effects to be executed. In particular, reducer functions must always be pure functions of (state, action) => newState. However, Redux's middleware makes it possible to intercept dispatched actions and add additional complex behavior around them, including side effects.\nIn general, Redux suggests that code with side effects should be part of the action creation process. While that logic can be performed inside of a UI component, it generally makes sense to extract that logic into a reusable function so that the same logic can be called from multiple places—in other words, an action creator function.\nThe simplest and most common way to do this is to add the Redux Thunk middleware that lets you write action creators with more complex and asynchronous logic. Another widely-used method is Redux Saga which lets you write more synchronous-looking code using generators, and can act like “background threads” or “daemons” in a Redux app. Yet another approach is Redux Loop, which inverts the process by allowing your reducers to declare side effects in response to state changes and have them executed separately. Beyond that, there are many other community-developed libraries and ideas, each with their own take on how side effects should be managed.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nAdvanced: Async Actions\nAdvanced: Async Flow\nAdvanced: Middleware\n\nArticles\n\nRedux Side-Effects and You\nPure functionality and side effects in Redux\nFrom Flux to Redux: Async Actions the easy way\nReact/Redux Links: \"Redux Side Effects\" category\nGist: Redux-Thunk examples\n\nDiscussions\n\n#291: Trying to put API calls in the right place\n#455: Modeling side effects\n#533: Simpler introduction to async action creators\n#569: Proposal: API for explicit side effects\n#1139: An alternative side effect model based on generators and sagas\nStack Overflow: Why do we need middleware for async flow in Redux?\nStack Overflow: How to dispatch a Redux action with a timeout?\nStack Overflow: Where should I put synchronous side effects linked to actions in redux?\nStack Overflow: How to handle complex side-effects in Redux?\nStack Overflow: How to unit test async Redux actions to mock ajax response\nStack Overflow: How to fire AJAX calls in response to the state changes with Redux?\nReddit: Help performing Async API calls with Redux-Promise Middleware.\nTwitter: possible comparison between sagas, loops, and other approaches\n\n\nShould I dispatch multiple actions in a row from one action creator?\nThere's no specific rule for how you should structure your actions. Using an async middleware like Redux Thunk certainly enables scenarios such as dispatching multiple distinct but related actions in a row, dispatching actions to represent progression of an AJAX request, dispatching actions conditionally based on state, or even dispatching an action and checking the updated state immediately afterwards.\nIn general, ask if these actions are related but independent, or should actually be represented as one action. Do what makes sense for your own situation but try to balance the readability of reducers with readability of the action log. For example, an action that includes the whole new state tree would make your reducer a one-liner, but the downside is now you have no history of why the changes are happening, so debugging gets really difficult. On the other hand, if you emit actions in a loop to keep them granular, it's a sign that you might want to introduce a new action type that is handled in a different way.\nTry to avoid dispatching several times synchronously in a row in the places where you're concerned about performance.  There are a number of addons and approaches that can batch up dispatches as well.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nFAQ: Performance - Reducing Update Events\n\nArticles\n\nIdiomatic Redux: Thoughts on Thunks, Sagas, Abstraction, and Reusability\n\nDiscussions\n\n#597: Valid to dispatch multiple actions from an event handler?\n#959: Multiple actions one dispatch?\nStack Overflow: Should I use one or several action types to represent this async action?\nStack Overflow: Do events and actions have a 1:1 relationship in Redux?\nStack Overflow: Should actions be handled by reducers to related actions or generated by action creators themselves?\nTwitter: \"Good thread on the problems with Redux Thunk...\"\n\n"},"docs/faq/ImmutableData.html":{"url":"docs/faq/ImmutableData.html","title":"Immutable Data","keywords":"","body":"Redux FAQ: Immutable Data\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are the benefits of immutability?\nWhy is immutability required by Redux?\nWhy does Redux’s use of shallow equality checking require immutability?\nHow do Shallow and Deep Equality Checking differ?\nHow does Redux use shallow equality checking?\nHow does combineReducers use shallow equality checking?\nHow does React-Redux use shallow equality checking?\nHow does React-Redux use shallow equality checking to determine whether a component needs re-rendering?\nWhy will shallow equality checking not work with mutable objects?\nDoes shallow equality checking with a mutable object cause problems with Redux?\nWhy does a reducer mutating the state prevent React-Redux from re-rendering a wrapped component?\nWhy does a selector mutating and returning a persistent object  to mapStateToProps prevent React-Redux from re-rendering a wrapped component?\nHow does immutability enable a shallow check to detect object mutations?\n\n\nHow can immutability in your reducers cause components to render unnecessarily?\nHow can immutability in mapStateToProps cause components to render unnecessarily?\nWhat approaches are there for handling data immutability?

In particular:\nRedux's combineReducers utility shallowly checks for reference changes  caused by the reducers that it calls.\nReact-Redux's connect method generates components that shallowly check reference changes to the root state, and the return values from the mapStateToProps function to see if the wrapped components actually need to re-render.\nSuch shallow checking requires immutability to function correctly.\n\n\nImmutable data management ultimately makes data handling safer.\nTime-travel debugging requires that reducers be pure functions with no side effects, so that you can correctly jump between different states.\n\nFurther Information\nDocumentation\n\nRecipes: Prerequisite Reducer Concepts\n\nDiscussions\n\nReddit: Why Redux Needs Reducers To Be Pure Functions\n\n\nWhy does Redux’s use of shallow equality checking require immutability?\nRedux's use of shallow equality checking requires immutability if any connected components are to be updated correctly. To see why, we need to understand the difference between shallow and deep equality checking in JavaScript.\n\nHow do shallow and deep equality checking differ?\nShallow equality checking (or reference equality) simply checks that two different variables reference the same object; in contrast, deep equality checking (or value equality) must check every value of two objects' properties.\nA shallow equality check is therefore as simple (and as fast) as a === b, whereas a deep equality check involves a recursive traversal through the properties of two objects, comparing the value of each property at each step.\nIt's for this improvement in performance that Redux uses shallow equality checking.\nFurther Information\nArticles\n\nPros and Cons of using immutability with React.js\n\n\nHow does Redux use shallow equality checking?\nRedux uses shallow equality checking in its combineReducers function to return either a new mutated copy of the root state object, or, if no mutations have been made, the current root state object.  \nFurther Information\nDocumentation\n\nAPI: combineReducers\n\n\nHow does combineReducers use shallow equality checking?\nThe suggested structure for a Redux store is to split the state object into multiple \"slices\" or \"domains\" by key, and provide a separate reducer function to manage each individual data slice.\ncombineReducers makes working with this style of structure easier by taking a  reducers argument that’s defined as a hash table comprising a set of key/value pairs, where each key is the name of a state slice, and the corresponding value is the reducer function that will act on it.\nSo, for example, if your state shape is { todos, counter }, the call to combineReducers would be:\ncombineReducers({ todos: myTodosReducer, counter: myCounterReducer })\n\nwhere:\n\nthe keys  todos and counter each refer to a separate state slice;\nthe values myTodosReducer and myCounterReducer are reducer functions, with each acting on the state slice identified by the respective key.\n\ncombineReducers iterates through each of these key/value pairs. For each iteration, it:\n\ncreates a reference to the current state slice referred to by each key;\ncalls the  appropriate reducer and passes it the slice;\ncreates a reference to the possibly-mutated state slice that's returned by the reducer.\n\nAs  it continues through the iterations, combineReducers will construct a new state object with the state slices returned from each reducer. This new state object may or may not be different from the current state object. It is here that combineReducers uses shallow equality checking to determine whether the state has changed.\nSpecifically, at each stage of the iteration, combineReducers performs a shallow equality check on the current state slice and the state slice returned from the reducer. If the reducer returns a new object, the shallow equality check will fail, and combineReducers will set a hasChanged flag to true.\nAfter the iterations have completed, combineReducers will check the state of the hasChanged flag. If it’s true, the newly-constructed state object will be returned. If it’s false, the current state object is returned.\nThis is worth emphasizing: If the reducers all return the same state object passed to them, then combineReducers will return the current root state object, not the newly updated one.\nFurther Information\nDocumentation\n\nAPI: combineReducers\nRedux FAQ - How do I share state between two reducers? do I have to use combineReducers?\n\nVideo\n\nEgghead.io: Redux: Implementing combineReducers() from Scratch\n\n\nHow does React-Redux use shallow equality checking?\nReact-Redux uses shallow equality checking to determine whether the component it’s wrapping needs to be re-rendered.\nTo do this, it assumes that the wrapped component is pure; that is, that the component will produce the same results given the same props and state.\nBy assuming the wrapped component is pure, it need only check whether the root state object or the values returned from mapStateToProps have changed. If they haven’t, the wrapped component does not need re-rendering.\nIt detects a change by keeping a reference to the root state object, and a reference to each value in the props object that's returned from the mapStateToProps function.\nIt then runs a shallow equality check on its reference to the root state object and the state object passed to it, and a separate series of shallow checks on each reference to the props object’s values and those that are returned from running the mapStateToProps function again.\nFurther Information\nDocumentation\n\nReact-Redux Bindings\n\nArticles\n\nAPI: React-Redux’s connect function and mapStateToProps\nTroubleshooting: My views aren’t updating when something changes outside of Redux\n\nWhy does React-Redux shallowly check each value within the props object returned from mapStateToProp?\nReact-Redux performs a shallow equality check on each value within the props object, not on the props object itself.\nIt does so because the props object is actually a hash of prop names and their values (or selector functions that are used to retrieve or generate the values), such as in this example:\nfunction mapStateToProps(state) {\n  return {\n    todos: state.todos, // prop value\n    visibleTodos: getVisibleTodos(state) // selector\n  }\n}\n\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(TodoApp)\n\nAs such, a shallow equality check of the props object returned from repeated calls to mapStateToProps would always fail, as a new object would be returned each time.\nReact-Redux therefore maintains separate references to each value in the returned props object.\nFurther Information\nArticles\n\nReact.js pure render performance anti-pattern\n\n\nHow does React-Redux use shallow equality checking to determine whether a component needs re-rendering?\nEach time React-Redux’s connect function is called, it will perform a shallow equality check on its stored reference to the root state object, and the current root state object passed to it from the store. If the check passes, the root state object has not been updated, and so there is no need to re-render the component, or even call mapStateToProps.\nIf the check fails, however, the root state object has been updated, and so connect will call mapStateToPropsto see if the props for the wrapped component have been updated.\nIt does this by performing a shallow equality check on each value within the object individually, and will only trigger a re-render if one of those checks fails.\nIn the example below, if state.todos and the value returned from getVisibleTodos() do not change on successive calls to connect, then the component will not re-render .\nfunction mapStateToProps(state) {\n  return {\n    todos: state.todos, // prop value\n    visibleTodos: getVisibleTodos(state) // selector\n  }\n}\n\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(TodoApp)\n\nConversely,  in this next example (below), the component will always re-render, as the value of todos is always a new object, regardless of whether or not its values change:\n// AVOID - will always cause a re-render\nfunction mapStateToProps(state) {\n  return {\n    // todos always references a newly-created object\n    todos: {\n      all: state.todos,\n      visibleTodos: getVisibleTodos(state)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(TodoApp)\n\nIf the shallow equality check fails between the new values returned from  mapStateToProps and the previous values that React-Redux kept a reference to, then a re-rendering of the component will be triggered.\nFurther Information\nArticles\n\nPractical Redux, Part 6: Connected Lists, Forms, and Performance\nReact.js Pure Render Performance Anti-Pattern\nHigh Performance Redux Apps\n\nDiscussions\n\n#1816: Component connected to state with mapStateToProps\n#300: Potential connect() optimization\n\n\nWhy will shallow equality checking not work with mutable objects?\nShallow equality checking cannot be used to detect if a function mutates an object passed into it if that object is mutable.\nThis is because two variables that reference the same object will always be equal, regardless of whether the object’s values changes or not, as they're both referencing the same object. Thus, the following will always return true:\nfunction mutateObj(obj) {\n  obj.key = 'newValue'\n  return obj\n}\n\nconst param = { key: 'originalValue' }\nconst returnVal = mutateObj(param)\n\nparam === returnVal\n//> true\n\nThe shallow check of param and returnValue simply checks whether both variables reference the same object, which they do.mutateObj() may return a mutated version of obj, but it's still the same object as that passed in. The fact that its values have been changed within mutateObj matters not at all to a shallow check.\nFurther Information\nArticles\n\nPros and Cons of using immutability with React.js\n\n\nDoes shallow equality checking with a mutable object cause problems with Redux?\nShallow equality checking with a mutable object will not cause problems with Redux, but it will cause problems with libraries that depend on the store, such as React-Redux.\nSpecifically, if the state slice passed to a reducer by combineReducers is a mutable object, the reducer can modify it directly and return it.\nIf it does, the shallow equality check that combineReducers performs will always pass, as the values of the state slice returned by the reducer may have been mutated, but the object itself has not - it’s still the same object that was passed to the reducer.\nAccordingly, combineReducers will not set its hasChanged flag, even though the state has changed. If none of the other reducers return a new, updated state slice, the hasChanged flag will remain set to false, causing combineReducers to return the existing root state object.\nThe store will still be updated with the new values for the root state, but because the root state object itself is still the same object, libraries that bind to Redux, such as React-Redux, will not be aware of the state’s mutation, and so will not trigger a wrapped component’s re-rendering.\nFurther Information\nDocumentation\n\nRecipes: Immutable Update Patterns\nTroubleshooting: Never mutate reducer arguments\n\n\nWhy does a reducer mutating the state prevent React-Redux from re-rendering a wrapped component?\nIf a Redux reducer directly mutates, and returns, the state object passed into it, the values of the root state object will change, but the object itself will not.\nBecause React-Redux performs a shallow check on the root state object to determine if its wrapped components need re-rendering or not, it will not be able to detect the state mutation, and so will not trigger a re-rendering.\nFurther Information\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting: My views aren’t updating when something changes outside of Redux\n\n\nWhy does a selector mutating and returning a persistent object  to mapStateToProps prevent React-Redux from re-rendering a wrapped component?\nIf one of the values of the props object returned from mapStateToProps is an object that persists across calls to connect (such as, potentially, the root state object), yet is directly mutated and returned by a selector function,  React-Redux will not be able to detect the mutation, and so will not trigger a re-render of the wrapped component.\nAs we’ve seen, the values in the mutable object returned by the selector function may have changed, but the object itself has not, and shallow equality checking only compares the objects themselves, not their values.\nFor example, the following mapStateToProps function will  never trigger a re-render:\n// State object held in the Redux store\nconst state = {\n  user: {\n    accessCount: 0,\n    name: 'keith'\n  }\n}\n\n// Selector function\nconst getUser = state => {\n  ++state.user.accessCount // mutate the state object\n  return state\n}\n\n// mapStateToProps\nconst mapStateToProps = state => ({\n  // The object returned from getUser() is always\n  // the same object, so this wrapped\n  // component will never re-render, even though it's been\n  // mutated\n  userRecord: getUser(state)\n})\n\nconst a = mapStateToProps(state)\nconst b = mapStateToProps(state)\n\na.userRecord === b.userRecord\n//> true\n\nNote that, conversely, if an immutable object is used, the component may re-render when it should not.\nFurther Information\nArticles\n\nPractical Redux, Part 6: Connected Lists, Forms, and Performance\n\nDiscussions\n\n#1948: Is getMappedItems an anti-pattern in mapStateToProps?\n\n\nHow does immutability enable a shallow check to detect object mutations?\nIf an object is immutable, any changes that need to be made to it within a function must be made to a copy of the object.\nThis mutated copy is a separate object from that passed into the function, and so when it is returned, a shallow check will identify it as being a different object from that passed in, and so will fail.\nFurther Information\nArticles\n\nPros and Cons of using immutability with React.js\n\n\nHow can immutability in your reducers cause components to render unnecessarily?\nYou cannot mutate an immutable object; instead, you must mutate a copy of it, leaving the original intact.\nThat’s perfectly OK when you mutate the copy, but in the context of a reducer, if you return a copy that hasn’t been mutated, Redux’s combineReducers function will still think that the state needs to be updated, as you're returning an entirely different object from the state slice object that was passed in.\ncombineReducers will then return this new root state object to the store. The new object will have the same values as the current root state object, but because it's a different object, it will cause the store to be updated, which will ultimately cause all connected components to be re-rendered unnecessarily.\nTo prevent this from happening, you must always return the state slice object that’s passed into a reducer if the reducer does not mutate the state.\nFurther Information\nArticles\n\nReact.js pure render performance anti-pattern\nBuilding Efficient UI with React and Redux\n\n\nHow can immutability in mapStateToProps cause components to render unnecessarily?\nCertain immutable operations, such as an Array filter, will always return a new object, even if the values themselves have not changed.\nIf such an operation is used as a selector function in mapStateToProps, the shallow equality check that React-Redux performs on each value\nin the props object that’s returned will always fail, as the selector is returning a new object each time.\nAs such, even though the values of that new object have not changed, the wrapped component will always be re-rendered,\nFor example, the following  will always trigger a re-render:\n// A JavaScript array's 'filter' method treats the array as immutable,\n// and returns a filtered copy of the array.\nconst getVisibleTodos = todos => todos.filter(t => !t.completed)\n\nconst state = {\n  todos: [\n    {\n      text: 'do todo 1',\n      completed: false\n    },\n    {\n      text: 'do todo 2',\n      completed: true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nconst mapStateToProps = state => ({\n  // getVisibleTodos() always returns a new array, and so the\n  // 'visibleToDos' prop will always reference a different array,\n  // causing the wrapped component to re-render, even if the array's\n  // values haven't changed\n  visibleToDos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos)\n})\n\nconst a = mapStateToProps(state)\n//  Call mapStateToProps(state) again with exactly the same arguments\nconst b = mapStateToProps(state)\n\na.visibleToDos\n//> { \"completed\": false, \"text\": \"do todo 1\" }\n\nb.visibleToDos\n//> { \"completed\": false, \"text\": \"do todo 1\" }\n\na.visibleToDos === b.visibleToDos\n//> false\n\nNote that, conversely, if the values in your props object refer to mutable objects, your component may not render when it should.\nFurther Information\nArticles\n\nReact.js pure render performance anti-pattern\nBuilding Efficient UI with React and Redux\nImmutableJS: worth the price?\n\n\nWhat approaches are there for handling data immutability? Do I have to use Immutable.JS?\nYou do not need to use Immutable.JS with Redux. Plain JavaScript, if written correctly, is perfectly capable of providing immutability without having to use an immutable-focused library.\nHowever, guaranteeing immutability with JavaScript is difficult, and it can be easy to mutate an object accidentally, causing bugs in your app that are extremely difficult to locate. For this reason, using an immutable update utility library such as Immutable.JS can significantly improve the reliability of your app, and make your app’s development much easier.\nFurther Information\nDiscussions\n\n#1185: Question: Should I use immutable data structures?\nIntroduction to Immutable.js and Functional Programming Concepts\n\n\nWhat are the issues with using plain JavaScript for immutable operations?\nJavaScript was never designed to provide guaranteed immutable operations. Accordingly, there are several issues you need to be aware of if you choose to use it for your immutable operations in your Redux app.\nAccidental Object Mutation\nWith JavaScript, you can accidentally mutate an object (such as the Redux state tree) quite easily without realizing it. For example, updating deeply nested properties, creating a new reference to an object instead of a new object, or performing a shallow copy rather than a deep copy, can all lead to inadvertent object mutations, and can trip up even the most experienced JavaScript coder.\nTo avoid these issues, ensure you follow the recommended immutable update patterns for ES6.\nVerbose Code\nUpdating complex nested state trees can lead to verbose code that is tedious to write and difficult to debug.\nPoor Performance\nOperating on JavaScript objects and arrays in an immutable way can be slow, particularly as your state tree grows larger.\nRemember, to change an immutable object, you must mutate a copy of it, and copying large objects can be slow as every property must be copied.\nIn contrast, immutable libraries such as Immutable.JS can employ sophisticated optimization techniques such as structural sharing , which effectively returns a new object that reuses much of the existing object being copied from.\nFor copying very large objects, plain JavaScript can be over 100 times slower than an optimized immutable library.\nFurther Information\nDocumentation\n\nImmutable Update Patterns for ES6\n\nArticles\n\nImmutable.js, persistent data structures and structural sharing\nA deep dive into Clojure’s data structures\nIntroduction to Immutable.js and Functional Programming Concepts\nJavaScript and Immutability\nImmutable Javascript using ES6 and beyond\nPros and Cons of using immutability with React.js - React Kung Fu\n\n"},"docs/faq/CodeStructure.html":{"url":"docs/faq/CodeStructure.html","title":"Code Structure","keywords":"","body":"Redux FAQ: Code Structure\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat should my file structure look like?

It's entirely possible (and encouraged) for a reducer defined in one folder to respond to an action defined in another folder.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nFAQ: Actions - \"1:1 mapping between reducers and actions?\"\n\nArticles\n\nHow to Scale React Applications (accompanying talk: Scaling React Applications)\nRedux Best Practices\nRules For Structuring (Redux) Applications \nA Better File Structure for React/Redux Applications\nOrganizing Large React Applications\nFour Strategies for Organizing Code\nEncapsulating the Redux State Tree\nRedux Reducer/Selector Asymmetry\nModular Reducers and Selectors\nMy journey towards a maintainable project structure for React/Redux\nReact/Redux Links: Architecture - Project File Structure\n\nDiscussions\n\n#839: Emphasize defining selectors alongside reducers\n#943: Reducer querying\nReact Boilerplate #27: Application Structure\nStack Overflow: How to structure Redux components/containers\nTwitter: There is no ultimate file structure for Redux\n\n\nHow should I split my logic between reducers and action creators? Where should my “business logic” go?\nThere's no single clear answer to exactly what pieces of logic should go in a reducer or an action creator. Some developers prefer to have “fat” action creators, with “thin” reducers that simply take the data in an action and blindly merge it into the corresponding state. Others try to emphasize keeping actions as small as possible, and minimize the usage of getState() in an action creator.  (For purposes of this question, other async approaches such as sagas and observables fall in the \"action creator\" category.)\nThere are some potential benefits from putting more logic into your reducers.  It's likely that the action types would be more semantic and more meaningful (such as \"USER_UPDATED\" instead of \"SET_STATE\").  In addition, having more logic in reducers means that more functionality will be affected by time travel debugging.\nThis comment sums up the dichotomy nicely:\n\nNow, the problem is what to put in the action creator and what in the reducer, the choice between fat and thin action objects. If you put all the logic in the action creator, you end up with fat action objects that basically declare the updates to the state. Reducers become pure, dumb, add-this, remove that, update these functions. They will be easy to compose. But not much of your business logic will be there.\nIf you put more logic in the reducer, you end up with nice, thin action objects, most of your data logic in one place, but your reducers are harder to compose since you might need info from other branches. You end up with large reducers or reducers that take additional arguments from higher up in the state.\n\nFind the balance between these two extremes, and you will master Redux.\nFurther information\nArticles\n\nWhere do I put my business logic in a React/Redux application?\nHow to Scale React Applications\nThe Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy.

You are free to create actions in any way that is best for you, including simply passing an object literal to dispatch. Action creators emerged from the Flux architecture and have been adopted by the Redux community because they offer several benefits.\nAction creators are more maintainable. Updates to an action can be made in one place and applied everywhere. All instances of an action are guaranteed to have the same shape and the same default values.\nAction creators are testable. The correctness of an inline action must be verified manually. Like any function, tests for an action creator can be written once and run automatically.  \nAction creators are easier to document. The action creator's parameters enumerate the action's dependencies. And centralization of the action definition provides a convenient place for documentation comments. When actions are written inline, this information is harder to capture and communicate.\nAction creators are a more powerful abstraction. Creating an action often involves transforming data or making AJAX requests. Action creators provide a uniform interface to this varied logic. This abstraction frees a component to dispatch an action without being complicated by the details of that action's creation.\nFurther information\nArticles\n\nIdiomatic Redux: Why use action creators?\n\nDiscussions\n\nReddit: Redbox - Redux action creation made simple\n\n"},"docs/faq/Performance.html":{"url":"docs/faq/Performance.html","title":"Performance","keywords":"","body":"Redux FAQ: Performance\nTable of Contents\n\nHow well does Redux “scale” in terms of performance and architecture?\nWon't calling “all my reducers” for each action be slow?\nDo I have to deep-clone my state in a reducer?

Will dispatching many actions take up memory?\nWill caching remote data cause memory problems?\n\nPerformance\n\nHow well does Redux “scale” in terms of performance and architecture?\nWhile there's no single definitive answer to this, most of the time this should not be a concern in either case.\nThe work done by Redux generally falls into a few areas: processing actions in middleware and reducers (including object duplication for immutable updates), notifying subscribers after actions are dispatched, and updating UI components based on the state changes. While it's certainly possible for each of these to become a performance concern in sufficiently complex situations, there's nothing inherently slow or inefficient about how Redux is implemented. In fact, React Redux in particular is heavily optimized to cut down on unnecessary re-renders, and React-Redux v5 shows noticeable improvements over earlier versions.\nRedux may not be as efficient out of the box when compared to other libraries.  For maximum rendering performance in a React application, state should be stored in a normalized shape, many individual components should be connected to the store instead of just a few, and connected list components should pass item IDs to their connected child list items (allowing the list items to look up their own data by ID).  This minimizes the overall amount of rendering to be done.  Use of memoized selector functions is also an important performance consideration.\nAs for architecture, anecdotal evidence is that Redux works well for varying project and team sizes. Redux is currently used by hundreds of companies and thousands of developers, with several hundred thousand monthly installations from NPM. One developer reported:\n\nfor scale, we have ~500 action types, ~400 reducer cases, ~150 components, 5 middlewares, ~200 actions, ~2300 tests\n\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nRecipes: Structuring Reducers - Normalizing State Shape\n\nArticles\n\nHow to Scale React Applications (accompanying talk: Scaling React Applications)\nHigh-Performance Redux\nImproving React and Redux Perf with Reselect\nEncapsulating the Redux State Tree\nReact/Redux Links: Performance - Redux\n\nDiscussions\n\n#310: Who uses Redux?\n#1751: Performance issues with large collections\nReact Redux #269: Connect could be used with a custom subscribe method\nReact Redux #407: Rewrite connect to offer an advanced API\nReact Redux #416: Rewrite connect for better performance and extensibility\nRedux vs MobX TodoMVC Benchmark: #1\nReddit: What's the best place to keep the initial state?\nReddit: Help designing Redux state for a single page app\nReddit: Redux performance issues with a large state object?\nReddit: React/Redux for Ultra Large Scale apps\nTwitter: Redux scaling\nTwitter: Redux vs MobX benchmark graph - Redux state shape matters\nStack Overflow: How to optimize small updates to props of nested components?\nChat log: React/Redux perf - updating a 10K-item Todo list\nChat log: React/Redux perf - single connection vs many connections\n\n\nWon't calling “all my reducers” for each action be slow?\nIt's important to note that a Redux store really only has a single reducer function. The store passes the current state and dispatched action to that one reducer function, and lets the reducer handle things appropriately.\nObviously, trying to handle every possible action in a single function does not scale well, simply in terms of function size and readability, so it makes sense to split the actual work into separate functions that can be called by the top-level reducer. In particular, the common suggested pattern is to have a separate sub-reducer function that is responsible for managing updates to a particular slice of state at a specific key. The combineReducers() that comes with Redux is one of the many possible ways to achieve this. It's also highly suggested to keep your store state as flat and as normalized as possible. Ultimately, though, you are in charge of organizing your reducer logic any way you want.\nHowever, even if you happen to have many different reducer functions composed together, and even with deeply nested state, reducer speed is unlikely to be a problem. JavaScript engines are capable of running a very large number of function calls per second, and most of your reducers are probably just using a switch statement and returning the existing state by default in response to most actions.\nIf you actually are concerned about reducer performance, you can use a utility such as redux-ignore or reduxr-scoped-reducer to ensure that only certain reducers listen to specific actions. You can also use redux-log-slow-reducers to do some performance benchmarking.\nFurther information\nDiscussions\n\n#912: Proposal: action filter utility\n#1303: Redux Performance with Large Store and frequent updates\nStack Overflow: State in Redux app has the name of the reducer\nStack Overflow: How does Redux deal with deeply nested models?\n\n\nDo I have to deep-clone my state in a reducer? Isn't copying my state going to be slow?\nImmutably updating state generally means making shallow copies, not deep copies. Shallow copies are much faster than deep copies, because fewer objects and fields have to be copied, and it effectively comes down to moving some pointers around.\nHowever, you do need to create a copied and updated object for each level of nesting that is affected. Although that shouldn't be particularly expensive, it's another good reason why you should keep your state normalized and shallow if possible.\n\nCommon Redux misconception: you need to deeply clone the state. Reality: if something inside doesn't change, keep its reference the same!\n\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nRecipes: Structuring Reducers - Prerequisite Concepts\nRecipes: Structuring Reducers - Immutable Update Patterns\n\nDiscussions\n\n#454: Handling big states in reducer\n#758: Why can't state be mutated?\n#994: How to cut the boilerplate when updating nested entities?\nTwitter: common misconception - deep cloning\nCloning Objects in JavaScript\n\n\nHow can I reduce the number of store update events?\nRedux notifies subscribers after each successfully dispatched action (i.e. an action reached the store and was handled by reducers). In some cases, it may be useful to cut down on the number of times subscribers are called, particularly if an action creator dispatches multiple distinct actions in a row.\nIf you use React, note that you can improve performance of multiple synchronous dispatches by wrapping them in ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates(), but this API is experimental and may be removed in any React release so don't rely on it too heavily. Take a look at redux-batched-actions (a higher-order reducer that lets you dispatch several actions as if it was one and “unpack” them in the reducer), redux-batched-subscribe (a store enhancer that lets you debounce subscriber calls for multiple dispatches), or redux-batch (a store enhancer that handles dispatching an array of actions with a single subscriber notification).\nFurther information\nDiscussions\n\n#125: Strategy for avoiding cascading renders\n#542: Idea: batching actions\n#911: Batching actions\n#1813: Use a loop to support dispatching arrays\nReact Redux #263: Huge performance issue when dispatching hundreds of actions\n\nLibraries\n\nRedux Addons Catalog: Store - Change Subscriptions\n\n\nWill having “one state tree” cause memory problems? Will dispatching many actions take up memory?\nFirst, in terms of raw memory usage, Redux is no different than any other JavaScript library. The only difference is that all the various object references are nested together into one tree, instead of maybe saved in various independent model instances such as in Backbone. Second, a typical Redux app would probably have somewhat less memory usage than an equivalent Backbone app because Redux encourages use of plain JavaScript objects and arrays rather than creating instances of Models and Collections. Finally, Redux only holds onto a single state tree reference at a time. Objects that are no longer referenced in that tree will be garbage collected, as usual.\nRedux does not store a history of actions itself. However, the Redux DevTools do store actions so they can be replayed, but those are generally only enabled during development, and not used in production.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nDocs: Async Actions\n\nDiscussions\n\nStack Overflow: Is there any way to \"commit\" the state in Redux to free memory?\nStack Overflow: Can a Redux store lead to a memory leak?\nStack Overflow: Redux and ALL the application state\nStack Overflow: Memory Usage Concern with Controlled Components\nReddit: What's the best place to keep initial state?\n\n\nWill caching remote data cause memory problems?\nThe amount of memory available to JavaScript applications running in a browser is finite. Caching data will cause performance problems when the size of the cache approaches the amount of available memory. This tends to be a problem when the cached data is exceptionally large or the session is exceptionally long-running. And while it is good to be aware of the potential for these problems, this awareness should not discourage you from efficiently caching reasonable amounts of data.\nHere are a few approaches to caching remote data efficiently:\nFirst, only cache as much data as the user needs. If your application displays a paginated list of records, you don't necessarily need to cache the entire collection. Instead, cache what is visible to the user and add to that cache when the user has (or will soon have) an immediate need for more data.\nSecond, cache an abbreviated form of a record when possible. Sometimes a record includes data that is not relevant to the user. If the application does not depend on this data, it can be omitted from the cache.\nThird, only cache a single copy of a record. This is especially important when records contain copies of other records. Cache a unique copy for each record and replace each nested copy with a reference. This is called normalization. Normalization is the preferred approach to storing relational data for several reasons, including efficient memory consumption.\nFurther information\nDiscussions\n\nStack Overflow: How to choose the Redux state shape for an app with list/detail views and pagination?\nTwitter: ...concerns over having \"too much data in the state tree\"...\nAdvanced Redux entity normalization\n\n"},"docs/faq/DesignDecisions.html":{"url":"docs/faq/DesignDecisions.html","title":"Design Decisions","keywords":"","body":"Redux FAQ: Design Decisions\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy doesn't Redux pass the state and action to subscribers? \nWhy doesn't Redux support using classes for actions and reducers? \nWhy does the middleware signature use currying?\nWhy does applyMiddleware use a closure for dispatch?\nWhy doesn't combineReducers include a third argument with the entire state when it calls each reducer?\nWhy doesn't mapDispatchToProps allow use of return values from getState() or mapStateToProps()?\n\nDesign Decisions\n\nWhy doesn't Redux pass the state and action to subscribers?\nSubscribers are intended to respond to the state value itself, not the action. Updates to the state processed synchronously, but notifications to subscribers can be batched or debounced, meaning that subscribers are not always notified with every action. This is a common performance optimization to avoid repeated re-rendering.\nBatching or debouncing is possible by using enhancers to override store.dispatch to change the way that subscribers are notified. Also, there are libraries that change Redux to process actions in batches to optimize performance and avoid repeated re-rendering:\n\nredux-batch allows passing an array of actions to store.dispatch() with only one notification,\nredux-batched-subscribe allows batching of subscribe notifications that occur as a result of dispatches.\n\nThe intended guarantee is that Redux eventually calls all subscribers with the most recent state available, but not that it always calls each subscriber for each action. The store state is available in the subscriber simply by calling store.getState(). The action cannot be made available in the subscribers without breaking the way that actions might be batched.\nA potential use-case for using the action inside a subscriber -- which is an unsupported feature -- is to ensure that a component only re-renders after certain kinds of actions.

Class instances for action objects and reducers are not supported because class instances make serialization and deserialization tricky. Deserialization methods like JSON.parse(string) will return a plain old Javascript object rather than class instances. \nAs described in the Store FAQ, if you are okay with things like persistence and time-travel debugging not working as intended, you are  welcome to put non-serializable items into your Redux store.\nSerialization enables the browser to store all actions that have been dispatched, as well as the previous store states, with much less memory. Rewinding and 'hot reloading' the store is central to the Redux developer experience and the function of Redux DevTools. This also enables deserialized actions to be stored on the server and re-serialized in the browser in the case of server-side rendering with Redux.\nFurther Information\nArticles\n\nCan I put functions, promises, or other non-serializable items in my store state?\n\nDiscussions\n\n#1171: Why doesn't Redux use classes for actions and reducers?\n\n\nWhy does the middleware signature use currying?\nThe curried function signature of declaring middleware is deemed unnecessary by some, because both store and next are available when the applyMiddleware function is executed.

As stated in Beyond combineReducers,combineReducers is deliberately limited to handle a single common use case: updating a state tree that is a plain Javascript object by delegating the work of updating each slice of state to a specific slice reducer. \nIt's not immediately obvious what a potential third argument to each reducer should be: the entire state tree, some callback function, some other part of the state tree, etc. If combineReducers doesn't fit your use case, consider using libraries like combineSectionReducers or reduceReducers for other options with deeply nested reducers and reducers that require access to the global state. \nIf none of the published utilities solve your use case, you can always write a function yourself that does just exactly what you need.\nFurther information\nArticles\n\nBeyond combineReducers\n\nDiscussions\n\n#1768 Allow reducers to consult global state\n\n\nWhy doesn't mapDispatchToProps allow use of return values from getState() or mapStateToProps()?\nThere have been requests to use either the entire state or the return value of mapState inside of mapDispatch, so that when functions are declared inside of mapDispatch, they can close over the latest returned values from the store. \nThis approach is not supported in mapDispatch because it would mean also calling mapDispatch every time the store is updated. This would cause the re-creation of functions with every state update, thus adding a lot of performance overhead.\nThe preferred way to handle this use-case--needing to alter props based on the current state and mapDispatchToProps functions--is to work from  mergeProps, the third argument to the connect function. If specified, it is passed the result of mapStateToProps(), mapDispatchToProps(), and the container component's props. The plain object returned from mergeProps will be passed as props to the wrapped component.\nFurther information\nDiscussions\n\n#237 Why doesn't mapDispatchToProps allow use of return values from getState() or mapStateToProps()?\n\n"},"docs/faq/ReactRedux.html":{"url":"docs/faq/ReactRedux.html","title":"React Redux","keywords":"","body":"Redux FAQ: React Redux\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy isn't my component re-rendering, or my mapStateToProps running?\nWhy is my component re-rendering too often?\nHow can I speed up my mapStateToProps?\nWhy don't I have this.props.dispatch available in my connected component?\nShould I only connect my top component, or can I connect multiple components in my tree?\n\nReact Redux\n\nWhy isn't my component re-rendering, or my mapStateToProps running?\nAccidentally mutating or modifying your state directly is by far the most common reason why components do not re-render after an action has been dispatched. Redux expects that your reducers will update their state “immutably”, which effectively means always making copies of your data, and applying your changes to the copies. If you return the same object from a reducer, Redux assumes that nothing has been changed, even if you made changes to its contents. Similarly, React Redux tries to improve performance by doing shallow equality reference checks on incoming props in shouldComponentUpdate, and if all references are the same, shouldComponentUpdate returns false to skip actually updating your original component.\nIt's important to remember that whenever you update a nested value, you must also return new copies of anything above it in your state tree. If you have state.a.b.c.d, and you want to make an update to d, you would also need to return new copies of c, b, a, and state. This state tree mutation diagram demonstrates how a change deep in a tree requires changes all the way up.\nNote that “updating data immutably” does not mean that you must use Immutable.js, although that is certainly an option. You can do immutable updates to plain JS objects and arrays using several different approaches:\n\nCopying objects using functions like Object.assign() or _.extend(), and array functions such as slice() and concat()\nThe array spread operator in ES6, and the similar object spread operator that is proposed for a future version of JavaScript\nUtility libraries that wrap immutable update logic into simpler functions\n\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting\nReact Redux: Troubleshooting\nRecipes: Using the Object Spread Operator\nRecipes: Structuring Reducers - Prerequisite Concepts\nRecipes: Structuring Reducers - Immutable Update Patterns\n\nArticles\n\nPros and Cons of Using Immutability with React\nReact/Redux Links: Immutable Data\n\nDiscussions\n\n#1262: Immutable data + bad performance\nReact Redux #235: Predicate function for updating component\nReact Redux #291: Should mapStateToProps be called every time an action is dispatched?\nStack Overflow: Cleaner/shorter way to update nested state in Redux?\nGist: state mutations\n\n\nWhy is my component re-rendering too often?\nReact Redux implements several optimizations to ensure your actual component only re-renders when actually necessary. One of those is a shallow equality check on the combined props object generated by the mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps arguments passed to connect. Unfortunately, shallow equality does not help in cases where new array or object instances are created each time mapStateToProps is called. A typical example might be mapping over an array of IDs and returning the matching object references, such as:\nconst mapStateToProps = state => {\n  return {\n    objects: state.objectIds.map(id => state.objects[id])\n  }\n}\n\nEven though the array might contain the exact same object references each time, the array itself is a different reference, so the shallow equality check fails and React Redux would re-render the wrapped component.\nThe extra re-renders could be resolved by saving the array of objects into the state using a reducer, caching the mapped array using Reselect, or implementing shouldComponentUpdate in the component by hand and doing a more in-depth props comparison using a function such as _.isEqual. Be careful to not make your custom shouldComponentUpdate() more expensive than the rendering itself! Always use a profiler to check your assumptions about performance.\nFor non-connected components, you may want to check what props are being passed in. A common issue is having a parent component re-bind a callback inside its render function, like . That creates a new function reference every time the parent re-renders. It's generally good practice to only bind callbacks once in the parent component's constructor.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nFAQ: Performance - Scaling\n\nArticles\n\nA Deep Dive into React Perf Debugging\nReact.js pure render performance anti-pattern\nImproving React and Redux Performance with Reselect\nEncapsulating the Redux State Tree\nReact/Redux Links: React/Redux Performance\n\nDiscussions\n\nStack Overflow: Can a React Redux app scale as well as Backbone?\n\nLibraries\n\nRedux Addons Catalog: DevTools - Component Update Monitoring\n\n\nHow can I speed up my mapStateToProps?\nWhile React Redux does work to minimize the number of times that your mapStateToProps function is called, it's still a good idea to ensure that your mapStateToProps runs quickly and also minimizes the amount of work it does. The common recommended approach is to create memoized “selector” functions using Reselect. These selectors can be combined and composed together, and selectors later in a pipeline will only run if their inputs have changed. This means you can create selectors that do things like filtering or sorting, and ensure that the real work only happens if needed.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nRecipes: Computed Derived Data\n\nArticles\n\nImproving React and Redux Performance with Reselect\n\nDiscussions\n\n#815: Working with Data Structures\nReselect #47: Memoizing Hierarchical Selectors\n\n\nWhy don't I have this.props.dispatch available in my connected component?\nThe connect() function takes two primary arguments, both optional. The first, mapStateToProps, is a function you provide to pull data from the store when it changes, and pass those values as props to your component. The second, mapDispatchToProps, is a function you provide to make use of the store's dispatch function, usually by creating pre-bound versions of action creators that will automatically dispatch their actions as soon as they are called.\nIf you do not provide your own mapDispatchToProps function when calling connect(), React Redux will provide a default version, which simply returns the dispatch function as a prop. That means that if you do provide your own function, dispatch is not automatically provided.  If you still want it available as a prop, you need to explicitly return it yourself in your mapDispatchToProps implementation.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nReact Redux API: connect()\n\nDiscussions\n\nReact Redux #89: can i wrap multi actionCreators into one props with name?\nReact Redux #145: consider always passing down dispatch regardless of what mapDispatchToProps does\nReact Redux #255: this.props.dispatch is undefined if using mapDispatchToProps\nStack Overflow: How to get simple dispatch from this.props using connect w/ Redux?\n\n\nShould I only connect my top component, or can I connect multiple components in my tree?\nEarly Redux documentation advised that you should only have a few connected components near the top of your component tree.  However, time and experience has shown that that generally requires a few components to know too much about the data requirements of all their descendants, and forces them to pass down a confusing number of props.\nThe current suggested best practice is to categorize your components as “presentational” or “container” components, and extract a connected container component wherever it makes sense:\n\nEmphasizing “one container component at the top” in Redux examples was a mistake. Don't take this as a maxim. Try to keep your presentation components separate. Create container components by connecting them when it's convenient. Whenever you feel like you're duplicating code in parent components to provide data for same kinds of children, time to extract a container. Generally as soon as you feel a parent knows too much about “personal” data or actions of its children, time to extract a container.\n\nIn fact, benchmarks have shown that more connected components generally leads to better performance than fewer connected components.\nIn general, try to find a balance between understandable data flow and areas of responsibility with your components.\nFurther information\nDocumentation\n\nBasics: Usage with React\nFAQ: Performance - Scaling\n\nArticles\n\nPresentational and Container Components\nHigh-Performance Redux\nReact/Redux Links: Architecture - Redux Architecture\nReact/Redux Links: Performance - Redux Performance\n\nDiscussions\n\nTwitter: emphasizing “one container” was a mistake\n#419: Recommended usage of connect\n#756: container vs component?\n#1176: Redux+React with only stateless components\nStack Overflow: can a dumb component use a Redux container?\n\n"},"docs/faq/Miscellaneous.html":{"url":"docs/faq/Miscellaneous.html","title":"Miscellaneous","keywords":"","body":"Redux FAQ: Miscellaneous\nTable of Contents\n\nAre there any larger, “real” Redux projects?\nHow can I implement authentication in Redux?\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nAre there any larger, “real” Redux projects?\nYes, lots of them!

Why does this happen? There may be several reasons for this.\nNever mutate reducer arguments\nIt is tempting to modify the state or action passed to you by Redux. Don't do this!\nRedux assumes that you never mutate the objects it gives to you in the reducer. Every single time, you must return the new state object. Even if you don't use a library like Immutable, you need to completely avoid mutation.\nImmutability is what lets react-redux efficiently subscribe to fine-grained updates of your state. It also enables great developer experience features such as time travel with redux-devtools.\nFor example, a reducer like this is wrong because it mutates the state:\nfunction todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      // Wrong! This mutates state\n      state.push({\n        text: action.text,\n        completed: false\n      })\n      return state\n    case 'COMPLETE_TODO':\n      // Wrong! This mutates state[action.index].\n      state[action.index].completed = true\n      return state\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nIt needs to be rewritten like this:\nfunction todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      // Return a new array\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        {\n          text: action.text,\n          completed: false\n        }\n      ]\n    case 'COMPLETE_TODO':\n      // Return a new array\n      return state.map((todo, index) => {\n        if (index === action.index) {\n          // Copy the object before mutating\n          return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n            completed: true\n          })\n        }\n        return todo\n      })\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nIt's more code, but it's exactly what makes Redux predictable and efficient. If you want to have less code, you can use a helper like React.addons.update to write immutable transformations with a terse syntax:\n// Before:\nreturn state.map((todo, index) => {\n  if (index === action.index) {\n    return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n      completed: true\n    })\n  }\n  return todo\n})\n\n// After\nreturn update(state, {\n  [action.index]: {\n    completed: {\n      $set: true\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nFinally, to update objects, you'll need something like _.extend from Underscore, or better, an Object.assign polyfill.\nMake sure that you use Object.assign correctly. For example, instead of returning something like Object.assign(state, newData) from your reducers, return Object.assign({}, state, newData). This way you don't override the previous state.\nYou can also enable the object spread operator proposal for a more succinct syntax:\n// Before:\nreturn state.map((todo, index) => {\n  if (index === action.index) {\n    return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n      completed: true\n    })\n  }\n  return todo\n})\n\n// After:\nreturn state.map((todo, index) => {\n  if (index === action.index) {\n    return { ...todo, completed: true }\n  }\n  return todo\n})\n\nNote that experimental language features are subject to change.\nAlso keep an eye out for nested state objects that need to be deeply copied. Both _.extend and Object.assign make a shallow copy of the state. See Updating Nested Objects for suggestions on how to deal with nested state objects.\nDon't forget to call dispatch(action)\nIf you define an action creator, calling it will not automatically dispatch the action. For example, this code will do nothing:\nTodoActions.js\nexport function addTodo(text) {\n  return { type: 'ADD_TODO', text }\n}\n\nAddTodo.js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport { addTodo } from './TodoActions'\n\nclass AddTodo extends Component {\n  handleClick() {\n    // Won't work!\n    addTodo('Fix the issue')\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n       this.handleClick()}>\n        Add\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nIt doesn't work because your action creator is just a function that returns an action. It is up to you to actually dispatch it. We can't bind your action creators to a particular Store instance during the definition because apps that render on the server need a separate Redux store for every request.\nThe fix is to call dispatch() method on the store instance:\nhandleClick() {\n  // Works! (but you need to grab store somehow)\n  store.dispatch(addTodo('Fix the issue'))\n}\n\nIf you're somewhere deep in the component hierarchy, it is cumbersome to pass the store down manually. This is why react-redux lets you use a connect higher-order component that will, apart from subscribing you to a Redux store, inject dispatch into your component's props.\nThe fixed code looks like this:\nAddTodo.js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { addTodo } from './TodoActions'\n\nclass AddTodo extends Component {\n  handleClick() {\n    // Works!\n    this.props.dispatch(addTodo('Fix the issue'))\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n       this.handleClick()}>\n        Add\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\n// In addition to the state, `connect` puts `dispatch` in our props.\nexport default connect()(AddTodo)\n\nYou can then pass dispatch down to other components manually, if you want to.\nMake sure mapStateToProps is correct\nIt's possible you're correctly dispatching an action and applying your reducer but the corresponding state is not being correctly translated into props.\nSomething else doesn't work\nAsk around on the #redux Reactiflux Discord channel, or create an issue.If you figure it out, edit this document as a courtesy to the next person having the same problem.\n"},"docs/Glossary.html":{"url":"docs/Glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\nThis is a glossary of the core terms in Redux, along with their type signatures. The types are documented using Flow notation.\nState\ntype State = any\n\nState (also called the state tree) is a broad term, but in the Redux API it usually refers to the single state value that is managed by the store and returned by getState(). It represents the entire state of a Redux application, which is often a deeply nested object.\nBy convention, the top-level state is an object or some other key-value collection like a Map, but technically it can be any type. Still, you should do your best to keep the state serializable. Don't put anything inside it that you can't easily turn into JSON.\nAction\ntype Action = Object\n\nAn action is a plain object that represents an intention to change the state. Actions are the only way to get data into the store. Any data, whether from UI events, network callbacks, or other sources such as WebSockets needs to eventually be dispatched as actions.\nActions must have a type field that indicates the type of action being performed. Types can be defined as constants and imported from another module. It's better to use strings for type than Symbols because strings are serializable.\nOther than type, the structure of an action object is really up to you. If you're interested, check out Flux Standard Action for recommendations on how actions should be constructed.\nSee also async action below.\nReducer\ntype Reducer = (state: S, action: A) => S\n\nA reducer (also called a reducing function) is a function that accepts an accumulation and a value and returns a new accumulation. They are used to reduce a collection of values down to a single value.\nReducers are not unique to Redux—they are a fundamental concept in functional programming.  Even most non-functional languages, like JavaScript, have a built-in API for reducing. In JavaScript, it's Array.prototype.reduce().\nIn Redux, the accumulated value is the state object, and the values being accumulated are actions. Reducers calculate a new state given the previous state and an action. They must be pure functions—functions that return the exact same output for given inputs. They should also be free of side-effects. This is what enables exciting features like hot reloading and time travel.\nReducers are the most important concept in Redux.\nDo not put API calls into reducers.\nDispatching Function\ntype BaseDispatch = (a: Action) => Action\ntype Dispatch = (a: Action | AsyncAction) => any\n\nA dispatching function (or simply dispatch function) is a function that accepts an action or an async action; it then may or may not dispatch one or more actions to the store.\nWe must distinguish between dispatching functions in general and the base dispatch function provided by the store instance without any middleware.\nThe base dispatch function always synchronously sends an action to the store's reducer, along with the previous state returned by the store, to calculate a new state. It expects actions to be plain objects ready to be consumed by the reducer.\nMiddleware wraps the base dispatch function. It allows the dispatch function to handle async actions in addition to actions. Middleware may transform, delay, ignore, or otherwise interpret actions or async actions before passing them to the next middleware. See below for more information.\nAction Creator\ntype ActionCreator = (...args: any) => Action | AsyncAction\n\nAn action creator is, quite simply, a function that creates an action. Do not confuse the two terms—again, an action is a payload of information, and an action creator is a factory that creates an action.\nCalling an action creator only produces an action, but does not dispatch it. You need to call the store's dispatch function to actually cause the mutation. Sometimes we say bound action creators to mean functions that call an action creator and immediately dispatch its result to a specific store instance.\nIf an action creator needs to read the current state, perform an API call, or cause a side effect, like a routing transition, it should return an async action instead of an action.\nAsync Action\ntype AsyncAction = any\n\nAn async action is a value that is sent to a dispatching function, but is not yet ready for consumption by the reducer. It will be transformed by middleware into an action (or a series of actions) before being sent to the base dispatch() function. Async actions may have different types, depending on the middleware you use. They are often asynchronous primitives, like a Promise or a thunk, which are not passed to the reducer immediately, but trigger action dispatches once an operation has completed.\nMiddleware\ntype MiddlewareAPI = { dispatch: Dispatch, getState: () => State }\ntype Middleware = (api: MiddlewareAPI) => (next: Dispatch) => Dispatch\n\nA middleware is a higher-order function that composes a dispatch function to return a new dispatch function. It often turns async actions into actions.\nMiddleware is composable using function composition. It is useful for logging actions, performing side effects like routing, or turning an asynchronous API call into a series of synchronous actions.\nSee applyMiddleware(...middlewares) for a detailed look at middleware.\nStore\ntype Store = {\n  dispatch: Dispatch\n  getState: () => State\n  subscribe: (listener: () => void) => () => void\n  replaceReducer: (reducer: Reducer) => void\n}\n\nA store is an object that holds the application's state tree.There should only be a single store in a Redux app, as the composition happens on the reducer level.\n\ndispatch(action) is the base dispatch function described above.\ngetState() returns the current state of the store.\nsubscribe(listener) registers a function to be called on state changes.\nreplaceReducer(nextReducer) can be used to implement hot reloading and code splitting. Most likely you won't use it.\n\nSee the complete store API reference for more details.\nStore creator\ntype StoreCreator = (reducer: Reducer, preloadedState: ?State) => Store\n\nA store creator is a function that creates a Redux store. Like with dispatching function, we must distinguish the base store creator, createStore(reducer, preloadedState) exported from the Redux package, from store creators that are returned from the store enhancers.\nStore enhancer\ntype StoreEnhancer = (next: StoreCreator) => StoreCreator\n\nA store enhancer is a higher-order function that composes a store creator to return a new, enhanced store creator. This is similar to middleware in that it allows you to alter the store interface in a composable way.\nStore enhancers are much the same concept as higher-order components in React, which are also occasionally called “component enhancers”.\nBecause a store is not an instance, but rather a plain-object collection of functions, copies can be easily created and modified without mutating the original store. There is an example in compose documentation demonstrating that.\nMost likely you'll never write a store enhancer, but you may use the one provided by the developer tools. It is what makes time travel possible without the app being aware it is happening. Amusingly, the Redux middleware implementation is itself a store enhancer.\n"},"docs/api/":{"url":"docs/api/","title":"API Reference","keywords":"","body":"API Reference\nThe Redux API surface is tiny. Redux defines a set of contracts for you to implement (such as reducers) and provides a few helper functions to tie these contracts together.\nThis section documents the complete Redux API.

You may optionally specify it to hydrate the state from the server in universal apps, or to restore a previously serialized user session. If you produced reducer with combineReducers, this must be a plain object with the same shape as the keys passed to it. Otherwise, you are free to pass anything that your reducer can understand.\n\n[enhancer] (Function): The store enhancer. You may optionally specify it to enhance the store with third-party capabilities such as middleware, time travel, persistence, etc. The only store enhancer that ships with Redux is applyMiddleware().\n\n\nReturns\n(Store): An object that holds the complete state of your app. The only way to change its state is by dispatching actions. You may also subscribe to the changes to its state to update the UI.\nExample\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\nfunction todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return state.concat([action.text])\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nlet store = createStore(todos, ['Use Redux'])\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  text: 'Read the docs'\n})\n\nconsole.log(store.getState())\n// [ 'Use Redux', 'Read the docs' ]\n\nTips\n\nDon't create more than one store in an application! Instead, use combineReducers to create a single root reducer out of many.\n\nIt is up to you to choose the state format. You can use plain objects or something like Immutable. If you're not sure, start with plain objects.\n\nIf your state is a plain object, make sure you never mutate it! For example, instead of returning something like Object.assign(state, newData) from your reducers, return Object.assign({}, state, newData). This way you don't override the previous state. You can also write return { ...state, ...newData } if you enable the object spread operator proposal.\n\nFor universal apps that run on the server, create a store instance with every request so that they are isolated. Dispatch a few data fetching actions to a store instance and wait for them to complete before rendering the app on the server.\n\nWhen a store is created, Redux dispatches a dummy action to your reducer to populate the store with the initial state. You are not meant to handle the dummy action directly. Just remember that your reducer should return some kind of initial state if the state given to it as the first argument is undefined, and you're all set.\n\nTo apply multiple store enhancers, you may use compose().\n\n\n"},"docs/api/Store.html":{"url":"docs/api/Store.html","title":"Store","keywords":"","body":"Store\nA store holds the whole state tree of your application.The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it.  \nA store is not a class. It's just an object with a few methods on it.To create it, pass your root reducing function to createStore.\n\nA Note for Flux Users\nIf you're coming from Flux, there is a single important difference you need to understand. Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, instead of adding stores, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. You can use a helper like combineReducers to combine them. This is similar to how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nStore Methods\n\ngetState()\ndispatch(action)\nsubscribe(listener)\nreplaceReducer(nextReducer)\n\nStore Methods\ngetState()\nReturns the current state tree of your application.It is equal to the last value returned by the store's reducer.\nReturns\n(any): The current state tree of your application.\n\n\ndispatch(action)\nDispatches an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change.\nThe store's reducing function will be called with the current getState() result and the given action synchronously. Its return value will be considered the next state. It will be returned from getState() from now on, and the change listeners will immediately be notified.\n\nA Note for Flux Users\nIf you attempt to call dispatch from inside the reducer, it will throw with an error saying “Reducers may not dispatch actions.” This is similar to “Cannot dispatch in a middle of dispatch” error in Flux, but doesn't cause the problems associated with it. In Flux, a dispatch is forbidden while Stores are handling the action and emitting updates. This is unfortunate because it makes it impossible to dispatch actions from component lifecycle hooks or other benign places.\nIn Redux, subscriptions are called after the root reducer has returned the new state, so you may dispatch in the subscription listeners. You are only disallowed to dispatch inside the reducers because they must have no side effects. If you want to cause a side effect in response to an action, the right place to do this is in the potentially async action creator.\n\nArguments\n\naction (Object†): A plain object describing the change that makes sense for your application. Actions are the only way to get data into the store, so any data, whether from the UI events, network callbacks, or other sources such as WebSockets needs to eventually be dispatched as actions. Actions must have a type field that indicates the type of action being performed. Types can be defined as constants and imported from another module. It's better to use strings for type than Symbols because strings are serializable. Other than type, the structure of an action object is really up to you. If you're interested, check out Flux Standard Action for recommendations on how actions could be constructed.\n\nReturns\n(Object†): The dispatched action (see notes).\nNotes\n† The “vanilla” store implementation you get by calling createStore only supports plain object actions and hands them immediately to the reducer.\nHowever, if you wrap createStore with applyMiddleware, the middleware can interpret actions differently, and provide support for dispatching async actions. Async actions are usually asynchronous primitives like Promises, Observables, or thunks.\nMiddleware is created by the community and does not ship with Redux by default. You need to explicitly install packages like redux-thunk or redux-promise to use it. You may also create your own middleware.\nTo learn how to describe asynchronous API calls, read the current state inside action creators, perform side effects, or chain them to execute in a sequence, see the examples for applyMiddleware.\nExample\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nlet store = createStore(todos, ['Use Redux'])\n\nfunction addTodo(text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('Read the docs'))\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('Read about the middleware'))\n\n\n\nsubscribe(listener)\nAdds a change listener. It will be called any time an action is dispatched, and some part of the state tree may potentially have changed. You may then call getState() to read the current state tree inside the callback.\nYou may call dispatch() from a change listener, with the following caveats:\n\nThe listener should only call dispatch() either in response to user actions or under specific conditions (e. g. dispatching an action when the store has a specific field). Calling dispatch() without any conditions is technically possible, however it leads to an infinite loop as every dispatch() call usually triggers the listener again.\n\nThe subscriptions are snapshotted just before every dispatch() call. If you subscribe or unsubscribe while the listeners are being invoked, this will not have any effect on the dispatch() that is currently in progress. However, the next dispatch() call, whether nested or not, will use a more recent snapshot of the subscription list.\n\nThe listener should not expect to see all state changes, as the state might have been updated multiple times during a nested dispatch() before the listener is called. It is, however, guaranteed that all subscribers registered before the dispatch() started will be called with the latest state by the time it exits.\n\n\nIt is a low-level API. Most likely, instead of using it directly, you'll use React (or other) bindings. If you commonly use the callback as a hook to react to state changes, you might want to write a custom observeStore utility. The Store is also an Observable, so you can subscribe to changes with libraries like RxJS. \nTo unsubscribe the change listener, invoke the function returned by subscribe.\nArguments\n\nlistener (Function): The callback to be invoked any time an action has been dispatched, and the state tree might have changed. You may call getState() inside this callback to read the current state tree. It is reasonable to expect that the store's reducer is a pure function, so you may compare references to some deep path in the state tree to learn whether its value has changed.\n\nReturns\n(Function): A function that unsubscribes the change listener.\nExample\nfunction select(state) {\n  return state.some.deep.property\n}\n\nlet currentValue\nfunction handleChange() {\n  let previousValue = currentValue\n  currentValue = select(store.getState())\n\n  if (previousValue !== currentValue) {\n    console.log(\n      'Some deep nested property changed from',\n      previousValue,\n      'to',\n      currentValue\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nlet unsubscribe = store.subscribe(handleChange)\nunsubscribe()\n\n\n\nreplaceReducer(nextReducer)\nReplaces the reducer currently used by the store to calculate the state.\nIt is an advanced API. You might need this if your app implements code splitting, and you want to load some of the reducers dynamically. You might also need this if you implement a hot reloading mechanism for Redux.\nArguments\n\nnextReducer (Function) The next reducer for the store to use.\n\n"},"docs/api/combineReducers.html":{"url":"docs/api/combineReducers.html","title":"combineReducers","keywords":"","body":"combineReducers(reducers)\nAs your app grows more complex, you'll want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state.\nThe combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.\nThe resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object.\nThe state produced by combineReducers() namespaces the states of each reducer under their keys as passed to combineReducers()\nExample:\nrootReducer = combineReducers({potato: potatoReducer, tomato: tomatoReducer})\n// This would produce the following state object\n{\n  potato: {\n    // ... potatoes, and other state managed by the potatoReducer ... \n  },\n  tomato: {\n    // ... tomatoes, and other state managed by the tomatoReducer, maybe some nice sauce? ...\n  }\n}\nYou can control state key names by using different keys for the reducers in the passed object. For example, you may call combineReducers({ todos: myTodosReducer, counter: myCounterReducer }) for the state shape to be { todos, counter }.\nA popular convention is to name reducers after the state slices they manage, so you can use ES6 property shorthand notation: combineReducers({ counter, todos }). This is equivalent to writing combineReducers({ counter: counter, todos: todos }).\n\nA Note for Flux Users\nThis function helps you organize your reducers to manage their own slices of state, similar to how you would have different Flux Stores to manage different state. With Redux, there is just one store, but combineReducers helps you keep the same logical division between reducers.\n\nArguments\n\nreducers (Object): An object whose values correspond to different reducing functions that need to be combined into one. See the notes below for some rules every passed reducer must follow.\n\n\nEarlier documentation suggested the use of the ES6 import * as reducers syntax to obtain the reducers object. This was the source of a lot of confusion, which is why we now recommend exporting a single reducer obtained using combineReducers() from reducers/index.js instead. An example is included below.\n\nReturns\n(Function): A reducer that invokes every reducer inside the reducers object, and constructs a state object with the same shape.\nNotes\nThis function is mildly opinionated and is skewed towards helping beginners avoid common pitfalls. This is why it attempts to enforce some rules that you don't have to follow if you write the root reducer manually.\nAny reducer passed to combineReducers must satisfy these rules:\n\nFor any action that is not recognized, it must return the state given to it as the first argument.\n\nIt must never return undefined. It is too easy to do this by mistake via an early return statement, so combineReducers throws if you do that instead of letting the error manifest itself somewhere else.\n\nIf the state given to it is undefined, it must return the initial state for this specific reducer. According to the previous rule, the initial state must not be undefined either. It is handy to specify it with ES6 optional arguments syntax, but you can also explicitly check the first argument for being undefined.\n\n\nWhile combineReducers attempts to check that your reducers conform to some of these rules, you should remember them, and do your best to follow them. combineReducers will check your reducers by passing undefined to them; this is done even if you specify initial state to Redux.createStore(combineReducers(...), initialState). Therefore, you must ensure your reducers work properly when receiving undefined as state, even if you never intend for them to actually receive undefined in your own code.\nExample\nreducers/todos.js\nexport default function todos(state = [], action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return state.concat([action.text])\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nreducers/counter.js\nexport default function counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return state + 1\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return state - 1\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nreducers/index.js\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux'\nimport todos from './todos'\nimport counter from './counter'\n\nexport default combineReducers({\n  todos,\n  counter\n})\n\nApp.js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport reducer from './reducers/index'\n\nlet store = createStore(reducer)\nconsole.log(store.getState())\n// {\n//   counter: 0,\n//   todos: []\n// }\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  text: 'Use Redux'\n})\nconsole.log(store.getState())\n// {\n//   counter: 0,\n//   todos: [ 'Use Redux' ]\n// }\n\nTips\n\nThis helper is just a convenience! You can write your own combineReducers that works differently, or even assemble the state object from the child reducers manually and write a root reducing function explicitly, like you would write any other function.\n\nYou may call combineReducers at any level of the reducer hierarchy. It doesn't have to happen at the top. In fact you may use it again to split the child reducers that get too complicated into independent grandchildren, and so on.\n\n\n"},"docs/api/applyMiddleware.html":{"url":"docs/api/applyMiddleware.html","title":"applyMiddleware","keywords":"","body":"applyMiddleware(...middleware)\nMiddleware is the suggested way to extend Redux with custom functionality. Middleware lets you wrap the store's dispatch method for fun and profit. The key feature of middleware is that it is composable. Multiple middleware can be combined together, where each middleware requires no knowledge of what comes before or after it in the chain.\nThe most common use case for middleware is to support asynchronous actions without much boilerplate code or a dependency on a library like Rx. It does so by letting you dispatch async actions in addition to normal actions.\nFor example, redux-thunk lets the action creators invert control by dispatching functions. They would receive dispatch as an argument and may call it asynchronously. Such functions are called thunks. Another example of middleware is redux-promise. It lets you dispatch a Promise async action, and dispatches a normal action when the Promise resolves.\nMiddleware is not baked into createStore and is not a fundamental part of the Redux architecture, but we consider it useful enough to be supported right in the core. This way, there is a single standard way to extend dispatch in the ecosystem, and different middleware may compete in expressiveness and utility.\nArguments\n\n...middleware (arguments): Functions that conform to the Redux middleware API. Each middleware receives Store's dispatch and getState functions as named arguments, and returns a function. That function will be given the next middleware's dispatch method, and is expected to return a function of action calling next(action) with a potentially different argument, or at a different time, or maybe not calling it at all. The last middleware in the chain will receive the real store's dispatch method as the next parameter, thus ending the chain. So, the middleware signature is ({ getState, dispatch }) => next => action.\n\nReturns\n(Function) A store enhancer that applies the given middleware. The store enhancer signature is createStore => createStore' but the easiest way to apply it is to pass it to createStore() as the last enhancer argument.\nExample: Custom Logger Middleware\nimport { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport todos from './reducers'\n\nfunction logger({ getState }) {\n  return next => action => {\n    console.log('will dispatch', action)\n\n    // Call the next dispatch method in the middleware chain.\n    let returnValue = next(action)\n\n    console.log('state after dispatch', getState())\n\n    // This will likely be the action itself, unless\n    // a middleware further in chain changed it.\n    return returnValue\n  }\n}\n\nlet store = createStore(\n  todos,\n  ['Use Redux'],\n  applyMiddleware(logger)\n)\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  text: 'Understand the middleware'\n})\n// (These lines will be logged by the middleware:)\n// will dispatch: { type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Understand the middleware' }\n// state after dispatch: [ 'Use Redux', 'Understand the middleware' ]\n\nExample: Using Thunk Middleware for Async Actions\nimport { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport thunk from 'redux-thunk'\nimport * as reducers from './reducers'\n\nlet reducer = combineReducers(reducers)\n// applyMiddleware supercharges createStore with middleware:\nlet store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunk))\n\nfunction fetchSecretSauce() {\n  return fetch('https://www.google.com/search?q=secret+sauce')\n}\n\n// These are the normal action creators you have seen so far.\n// The actions they return can be dispatched without any middleware.\n// However, they only express “facts” and not the “async flow”.\nfunction makeASandwich(forPerson, secretSauce) {\n  return {\n    type: 'MAKE_SANDWICH',\n    forPerson,\n    secretSauce\n  }\n}\n\nfunction apologize(fromPerson, toPerson, error) {\n  return {\n    type: 'APOLOGIZE',\n    fromPerson,\n    toPerson,\n    error\n  }\n}\n\nfunction withdrawMoney(amount) {\n  return {\n    type: 'WITHDRAW',\n    amount\n  }\n}\n\n// Even without middleware, you can dispatch an action:\nstore.dispatch(withdrawMoney(100))\n\n// But what do you do when you need to start an asynchronous action,\n// such as an API call, or a router transition?\n\n// Meet thunks.\n// A thunk is a function that returns a function.\n// This is a thunk.\nfunction makeASandwichWithSecretSauce(forPerson) {\n\n  // Invert control!\n  // Return a function that accepts `dispatch` so we can dispatch later.\n  // Thunk middleware knows how to turn thunk async actions into actions.\n  return function (dispatch) {\n    return fetchSecretSauce().then(\n      sauce => dispatch(makeASandwich(forPerson, sauce)),\n      error => dispatch(apologize('The Sandwich Shop', forPerson, error))\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n// Thunk middleware lets me dispatch thunk async actions\n// as if they were actions!\nstore.dispatch(makeASandwichWithSecretSauce('Me'))\n\n// It even takes care to return the thunk's return value\n// from the dispatch, so I can chain Promises as long as I return them.\nstore.dispatch(makeASandwichWithSecretSauce('My wife')).then(() => {\n  console.log('Done!')\n})\n\n// In fact I can write action creators that dispatch\n// actions and async actions from other action creators,\n// and I can build my control flow with Promises.\nfunction makeSandwichesForEverybody() {\n  return function (dispatch, getState) {\n    if (!getState().sandwiches.isShopOpen) {\n\n      // You don't have to return Promises, but it's a handy convention\n      // so the caller can always call .then() on async dispatch result.\n      return Promise.resolve()\n    }\n\n    // We can dispatch both plain object actions and other thunks,\n    // which lets us compose the asynchronous actions in a single flow.\n    return dispatch(makeASandwichWithSecretSauce('My Grandma'))\n      .then(() =>\n        Promise.all([\n          dispatch(makeASandwichWithSecretSauce('Me')),\n          dispatch(makeASandwichWithSecretSauce('My wife'))\n        ])\n      )\n      .then(() => dispatch(makeASandwichWithSecretSauce('Our kids')))\n      .then(() =>\n        dispatch(\n          getState().myMoney > 42\n            ? withdrawMoney(42)\n            : apologize('Me', 'The Sandwich Shop')\n        )\n      )\n  }\n}\n\n// This is very useful for server side rendering, because I can wait\n// until data is available, then synchronously render the app.\n\nimport { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'\n\nstore\n  .dispatch(makeSandwichesForEverybody())\n  .then(() => response.send(renderToString()))\n\n// I can also dispatch a thunk async action from a component\n// any time its props change to load the missing data.\n\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { Component } from 'react'\n\nclass SandwichShop extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.props.dispatch(makeASandwichWithSecretSauce(this.props.forPerson))\n  }\n\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    if (nextProps.forPerson !== this.props.forPerson) {\n      this.props.dispatch(makeASandwichWithSecretSauce(nextProps.forPerson))\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.sandwiches.join('mustard')}\n  }\n}\n\nexport default connect(state => ({\n  sandwiches: state.sandwiches\n}))(SandwichShop)\n\nTips\n\nMiddleware only wraps the store's dispatch function. Technically, anything a middleware can do, you can do manually by wrapping every dispatch call, but it's easier to manage this in a single place and define action transformations on the scale of the whole project.\n\nIf you use other store enhancers in addition to applyMiddleware, make sure to put applyMiddleware before them in the composition chain because the middleware is potentially asynchronous. For example, it should go before redux-devtools because otherwise the DevTools won't see the raw actions emitted by the Promise middleware and such.\n\nIf you want to conditionally apply a middleware, make sure to only import it when it's needed:\nlet middleware = [a, b]\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n  let c = require('some-debug-middleware')\n  let d = require('another-debug-middleware')\n  middleware = [...middleware, c, d]\n}\n\nconst store = createStore(\n  reducer,\n  preloadedState,\n  applyMiddleware(...middleware)\n)\n\nThis makes it easier for bundling tools to cut out unneeded modules and reduces the size of your builds.\n\nEver wondered what applyMiddleware itself is? It ought to be an extension mechanism more powerful than the middleware itself. Indeed, applyMiddleware is an example of the most powerful Redux extension mechanism called store enhancers. It is highly unlikely you'll ever want to write a store enhancer yourself. Another example of a store enhancer is redux-devtools. Middleware is less powerful than a store enhancer, but it is easier to write.\n\nMiddleware sounds much more complicated than it really is. The only way to really understand middleware is to see how the existing middleware works, and try to write your own. The function nesting can be intimidating, but most of the middleware you'll find are, in fact, 10-liners, and the nesting and composability is what makes the middleware system powerful.\n\nTo apply multiple store enhancers, you may use compose().\n\n\n"},"docs/api/bindActionCreators.html":{"url":"docs/api/bindActionCreators.html","title":"bindActionCreators","keywords":"","body":"bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch)\nTurns an object whose values are action creators, into an object with the same keys, but with every action creator wrapped into a dispatch call so they may be invoked directly.\nNormally you should just call dispatch directly on your Store instance.

If you passed a function as actionCreators, the return value will also be a single function.\nExample\nTodoActionCreators.js\nexport function addTodo(text) {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    text\n  }\n}\n\nexport function removeTodo(id) {\n  return {\n    type: 'REMOVE_TODO',\n    id\n  }\n}\n\nSomeComponent.js\nimport { Component } from 'react'\nimport { bindActionCreators } from 'redux'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\nimport * as TodoActionCreators from './TodoActionCreators'\nconsole.log(TodoActionCreators)\n// {\n//   addTodo: Function,\n//   removeTodo: Function\n// }\n\nclass TodoListContainer extends Component {\n  constructor(props) { \n    super(props);\n\n    const {dispatch} = props;\n\n    // Here's a good use case for bindActionCreators:\n    // You want a child component to be completely unaware of Redux.\n    // We create bound versions of these functions now so we can\n    // pass them down to our child later.\n\n    this.boundActionCreators = bindActionCreators(TodoActionCreators, dispatch)\n    console.log(this.boundActionCreators)\n    // {\n    //   addTodo: Function,\n    //   removeTodo: Function\n    // }\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    // Injected by react-redux:\n    let { dispatch } = this.props\n\n    // Note: this won't work:\n    // TodoActionCreators.addTodo('Use Redux')\n\n    // You're just calling a function that creates an action.\n    // You must dispatch the action, too!\n\n    // This will work:\n    let action = TodoActionCreators.addTodo('Use Redux')\n    dispatch(action)\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // Injected by react-redux:\n    let { todos } = this.props\n\n    return \n\n    // An alternative to bindActionCreators is to pass\n    // just the dispatch function down, but then your child component\n    // needs to import action creators and know about them.\n\n    // return \n  }\n}\n\nexport default connect(\n  state => ({ todos: state.todos })\n)(TodoListContainer)\n\nTips\n\nYou might ask: why don't we bind the action creators to the store instance right away, like in classical Flux? The problem is that this won't work well with universal apps that need to render on the server. Most likely you want to have a separate store instance per request so you can prepare them with different data, but binding action creators during their definition means you're stuck with a single store instance for all requests.\n\nIf you use ES5, instead of import * as syntax you can just pass require('./TodoActionCreators') to bindActionCreators as the first argument. The only thing it cares about is that the values of the actionCreators arguments are functions. The module system doesn't matter.\n\n\n"},"docs/api/compose.html":{"url":"docs/api/compose.html","title":"compose","keywords":"","body":"compose(...functions)\nComposes functions from right to left.\nThis is a functional programming utility, and is included in Redux as a convenience.You might want to use it to apply several store enhancers in a row.\nArguments\n\n(arguments): The functions to compose. Each function is expected to accept a single parameter. Its return value will be provided as an argument to the function standing to the left, and so on. The exception is the right-most argument which can accept multiple parameters, as it will provide the signature for the resulting composed function.\n\nReturns\n(Function): The final function obtained by composing the given functions from right to left.\nExample\nThis example demonstrates how to use compose to enhance a store with applyMiddleware and a few developer tools from the redux-devtools package.\nimport { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux'\nimport thunk from 'redux-thunk'\nimport DevTools from './containers/DevTools'\nimport reducer from '../reducers'\n\nconst store = createStore(\n  reducer,\n  compose(\n    applyMiddleware(thunk),\n    DevTools.instrument()\n  )\n)\n\nTips\n\nAll compose does is let you write deeply nested function transformations without the rightward drift of the code.
