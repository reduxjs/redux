> Note: If you enjoyed Dan's course, consider supporting Egghead by [buying a subscription](https://egghead.io/pricing). Subscribers have access to the source code of every example in my videos and tons of advanced lessons on other topics, including JavaScript in depth, React, Angular, and more. Many [Egghead instructors](https://egghead.io/instructors) are also open source library authors, so buying a subscription is a nice way to thank them for the work that they've done.

### Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux

The **[Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)** course is a second free video series by Dan Abramov. It picks up where the first series left off, and covers practical production ready techniques for building your React and Redux applications: advanced state management, middleware, React Router integration, and other common problems you are likely to encounter while building applications for your clients and customers. As with the first series, **this course will always be free**.

## Practical Redux course

**[Practical Redux](https://www.educative.io/collection/5687753853370368/5707702298738688/)** is a paid interactive course by Redux co-maintainer [Mark Erikson](https://twitter.com/acemarke). The course is designed to show how to apply the basic concepts of Redux to building something larger than a TodoMVC application. It includes real-world topics like:

- Adding Redux to a new Create-React-App project and configuring Hot Module Replacement for faster development
- Controling your UI behavior with Redux
- Using the Redux-ORM library to manage relational data in your Redux store
- Building a master/detail view to display and edit data
- Writing custom advanced Redux reducer logic to solve specific problems
- Optimizing performance of Redux-connected form inputs

And much more!

The course is based on Mark's original free **["Practical Redux" blog tutorial series](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/practical-redux/)**, but with updated and improved content.
