## Introduction

Welcome to the Redux Toolkit Quick Start tutorial! **This tutorial will briefly introduce you to Redux Toolkit and teach you how to start using it correctly**.

### How to Read This Tutorial

This page will focus on just how to set up a Redux application with Redux Toolkit and the main APIs you'll use. For explanations of what Redux is, how it works, and full examples of how to use Redux Toolkit, [see the tutorials linked in the "Tutorials Index" page](./tutorials-index.md).

For this tutorial, we assume that you're using Redux Toolkit with React, but you can also use it with other UI layers as well. The examples are based on [a typical Create-React-App folder structure](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure) where all the application code is in a `src`, but the patterns can be adapted to whatever project or folder setup you're using.

The [Redux+JS template for Create-React-App](https://github.com/reduxjs/cra-template-redux) comes with this same project setup already configured.

## Usage Summary

### Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux

Add the Redux Toolkit and React-Redux packages to your project:

```sh
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

### Create a Redux Store

Create a file named `src/app/store.js`. Import the `configureStore` API from Redux Toolkit. We'll start by creating an empty Redux store, and exporting it:

```js title="app/store.js"
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export default configureStore({
  reducer: {}
})
```

This creates a Redux store, and also automatically configure the Redux DevTools extension so that you can inspect the store while developing.

### Provide the Redux Store to React

Once the store is created, we can make it available to our React components by putting a React-Redux `<Provider>` around our application in `src/index.js`. Import the Redux store we just created, put a `<Provider>` around your `<App>`, and pass the store as a prop:

```js title="index.js"
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'
// highlight-start
import store from './app/store'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
// highlight-end

ReactDOM.render(
  // highlight-next-line
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

### Create a Redux State Slice

Add a new file named `src/features/counter/counterSlice.js`. In that file, import the `createSlice` API from Redux Toolkit.

Creating a slice requires a string name to identify the slice, an initial state value, and one or more reducer functions to define how the state can be updated. Once a slice is created, we can export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function for the whole slice.

Redux requires that [we write all state updates immutably, by making copies of data and updating the copies](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-2-concepts-data-flow#immutability). However, Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` and `createReducer` APIs use [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) inside to allow us to [write "mutating" update logic that becomes correct immutable updates](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-8-modern-redux#immutable-updates-with-immer).

```js title="features/counter/counterSlice.js"
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: {
    value: 0
  },
  reducers: {
    increment: state => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1
    },
    decrement: state => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload
    }
  }
})

// Action creators are generated for each case reducer function
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions

export default counterSlice.reducer
```

### Add Slice Reducers to the Store

Next, we need to import the reducer function from the counter slice and add it to our store. By defining a field inside the `reducer` parameter, we tell the store to use this slice reducer function to handle all updates to that state.

```js title="app/store.js"
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
// highlight-next-line
import counterReducer from '../features/counter/counterSlice'

export default configureStore({
  reducer: {
    // highlight-next-line
    counter: counterReducer
  }
})
```

### Use Redux State and Actions in React Components

Now we can use the React-Redux hooks to let React components interact with the Redux store. We can read data from the store with `useSelector`, and dispatch actions using `useDispatch`. Create a `src/features/counter/Counter.js` file with a `<Counter>` component inside, then import that component into `App.js` and render it inside of `<App>`.

```jsx title="features/counter/Counter.js"
import React from 'react'
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
import { decrement, increment } from './counterSlice'
import styles from './Counter.module.css'

export function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector(state => state.counter.value)
  const dispatch = useDispatch()

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button
          aria-label="Increment value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
        >
          Increment
        </button>
        <span>{count}</span>
        <button
          aria-label="Decrement value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}
        >
          Decrement
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, any time you click the "Increment" and "Decrement" buttons:

- The corresponding Redux action will be dispatched to the store
- The counter slice reducer will see the actions and update its state
- The `<Counter>` component will see the new state value from the store and re-render itself with the new data

## What You've Learned

That was a brief overview of how to set up and use Redux Toolkit with React. Recapping the details:

:::tip Summary

- **Create a Redux store with `configureStore`**
  - `configureStore` accepts a `reducer` function as a named argument
  - `configureStore` automatically sets up the store with good default settings
- **Provide the Redux store to the React application components**
  - Put a React-Redux `<Provider>` component around your `<App />`
  - Pass the Redux store as `<Provider store={store}>`
- **Create a Redux "slice" reducer with `createSlice`**
  - Call `createSlice` with a string name, an initial state, and named reducer functions
  - Reducer functions may "mutate" the state using Immer
  - Export the generated slice reducer and action creators
- **Use the React-Redux `useSelector/useDispatch` hooks in React components**
  - Read data from the store with the `useSelector` hook
  - Get the `dispatch` function with the `useDispatch` hook, and dispatch actions as needed
